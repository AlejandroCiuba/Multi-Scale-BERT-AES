4699	Have it ever occured to you that some of the things we read about and take home from libraries are not for young children?   Certain materials that are found in libraries are sometimes not age appropriate or even offensive to other people. Not all books, music, movies, and magazines offend people or condone in things but they also give children the right to learn about things or know things that are to rated and shouldnt be learned at a library. Most music in todays society is not appropiate because of the content that is used such as sex,drugs, and violence. last fall when I visited my shools library I came across a movie that I thought was not school appropiate and should'nt be seen without a parents verification. Anything about sex and drugs give young teens and children the right away to do it even if they read it, heard it, or saw it in school.  when im walking through the town and I see teens doing things that should'nt be done the first thing the first thing he/or she says is 'I heard it on a movie'. Most public lbraries have movies, book, music, and etc on shelves that aren't appropiate but it should'nt be welcomed to young children. most librians are busy and cant watch the entire library, but can make sure it is secured and put away from juveniles.   Most of the time a child will read what looks interesting and fun. Todays books that condone violence have guns drugs and sexual content on the front cover making it hard for a child not to want to read it. In a school library @PERCENT1 of the time all books are age appropiate, but in a public library it's not because the public library is not just for children but for adults too. some books shouldnt be of shelves but the rated things should be.  In conclusion libraries need to watch what's being checked out no matter who its from and I.d should be asked for.	3
3947	Know you ask me to write an essay to a newspaper reflecting my views on censorship in libraries.  Well ok then I will you my not like what I have to say but I really dont care @CAPS1 if it was up to your dam goverment to decide what we could say or what we can read or even do. Theyd have us all in our house with our hands tied so we couldent learn more then how to eat, clean, and dress our selfs.      Now the way I see it is that we have every rite to read any book we please when we whant to read it. now if we dont want to read a book then we dont have to read it. but we as a people and they as a goverment do not have the rite to take your books out of the libraries. Now we as a people can press any thing we want @CAPS1 no matter what they as in the goverment thinks it is the people who run the stat not the dam goverment.     My point is, is that the books are there to teach us about our lives, our histoy. Books teach us about what wrong and what is rite. Books are here to give sceary story by a camp fire they are here to give kids a bed time story.  If we take thos books off our shelves you think the kids of your generation are bad just wait @CAPS1 the next one will be worse than this one i promise you that.      Now it is our rite to save our books, @CAPS1 if we do not then us as @CAPS3 will be lost. For without book our passed is lost, our fock tales are forgoten, our kids will not be able to sleep at night without there storys.      Now come guy as a all pull it together. If you see a book on the shevles and you think its offences then by @CAPS4 put the dam thing down and walk away from it dont complane about it. No one told you that you had to read it. So don't ruine it for everyone just @CAPS1 eather you dont belive in @CAPS4 and you think that the bibles not rite then dont touch. its the same way around if you do bleave in @CAPS4 and you think that all book that tell about a witch or vampires or that my even have a hore house in just leave it alone. its just a dam book let us read them. See you guy blame us kids that the vido games roten our minds but realy its the parent that dose @CAPS1 see there is nothing more a teenanger like myself loves to do more than to do something there mom or dad says not. So gut just back off and let us read and play and do what in the hell we want to do.	3
3407	Books are important in the life of human beings wheather they are for studies,entertainment, or any other use. On the other hand, are some books offensive to readers. If certain books are offensive should you stay away from that type of book or get rid of the book altogether. With this being said, Should certain material be removed from shelves if they are offensive? Some reasons against this are you are taught to stay away from bad things, some people have different views of 'bad', and even if they are offensive they do not need to be removed.     Some materials are offensive to some people but not to others. This is the case in anything for example movies, books, and daily life. Some people @MONTH1 think the type of words used in a book make it bad, but to others that is what makes the book. For example to show the full amount of hatred for a character you have to use some offensive words. Another example is describing how horrible a person was killed, it is not enough to say he got stabbed and beat, you have to describe just how brutal it was to please some readers.       Another reason why books should not be removed is people are taught when to tell that something is offensive. If a reader discovers a book is offensive they should know to stop reading not finish the book then complain about offensive material. Also if a person rents a movie they know they aren't allowed to get an @CAPS1-rated movie then they should get another movie. People should know to not get a book read about the offensive stuff without stopping then go complain. If a person was concerned about a certain material they could ask people or go online to see if it is offensive or not.     Even if a certain material is offensive it should not be removed. That is only the opinion of sombody. If the book was needed by somebody they would not be able to get it because it was removed. If material were removed because someone said it was offensive then ther would never be any more books. For the reason that anyone can be offended, so they might just say it was worse than it actually was because they are mad.      For those reasons materials should not be removed. What if everybody started saying things were offensive ther would not be any more books. People should not have the complete say in the removal of books. Otherwise people would complain just out of spite towards certain people's material. So do you believe that certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive.	4
3484	I think that people who find them offensive just need to stay away from them type of books, music, movies and magazines. Some of the books people need to know about. Take the consentration camps for instince, people need to learn about them so we can prevent that horrible event from happining again.     I think that by letting people read those types of books it help us understand and learn what happened in the passed. So we need to keep the books on the shelf and let people learn if not we could be in danger. They can be in danger by someone being like @PERSON1 and killing millions of jews just because they look diferent. Also like slavery just because they are a different color doesnt mean they are not human. So keeping them in shelves could help our future.     Also if you are disturbed by music or movies then simply dont listen/watch them but let other people who is interested in them learn. My mom thinks that bloody-scarry movies shouldn't be allowed to sell in stores but i told her that thats what some people like watching and that people need to watch some of them to try to not let anything like them happen ever.     In conclution, we should keep some of these bad books, music, movies and magazines on the shelves so we will fight to keep horible historical events form happining again	3
3679	Libraries @CAPS1't Remove Books     @CAPS2 i would like to start off this story by stating i don't believe that libraries should remove books if they are offensive. If a book is offensive thats not a reason to take it off the shelves we watch movies in school today showing the past when @LOCATION1 had slaves.     I myself don't believe it is fair to show a movie in school about slavery but we cant have a book that doesnt actually show anything to us just tells us whats going on. In my eyes a book is less harmless then wating a show on the subject. A movie can show alot more detail in it then a book can so i say let the books stay where they are. Don't try to shut down a author beacuse you dont like what they wrote their might be more meaning in the book then you can see. Just keep reading you never know how the story might go on. Just like dont judge a book by its cover.     We @CAPS1't take away a book someone might like. Someone might hate the book but beacuse they hate it would you quit reading it? I don't believe it is right to remove something beacuse someone might not like what is it saying. i myslef see alot of things i don like everyday but i do not try getting everything changed. This is life as i know it there is alot of offencive people in this world and it wont change anytime soon not for me or anyone. Unless they make a law against being offencive.     I can see someone in a band saying something offencive about someone but we cant not sell his cd's beacuse someone might like what he said in that song. Or i dont like alot of shows and or movies on tv but i dont try to get the station shut down i just change the channel. As should lets say someone in a book store sees a offencive book they should just look away. Not go and try to get it shut down.     All i can really say tho is that i couldnt tell you what i would do beacuse i dont read very many books so i dont see them being offencive. So i can not tell you i wouldnt be mad but i still would just put the book down and not touch it again.	3
4747	When you walk into the heavenly sanctuary that is our library, you have opened yourself up to a vast wealth of knowledge that is available to you at the click of a mouse, the push of a button, or the turn of a page. There are those of a select few, however, who are under the paradigm that not all of this information is for all eyes. They feel it should be locked away, as if it were some eyesore. Allow me to address this view with retaliation and distaste on a number of levels in the following document.     I am a musician. Music is my passion. My creative gears are forever turning. Often I look to other artists' works for inspiration, and the one place to get that music is, you guessed it, the library. How disappointed am I when I find that the music I want has been removed for being explicit. It was not the lyrics or foul message I sought, but the beautiful melodies and harmonies therein! It does not do well to isolate media without first seeing the good that lies in it and the strong feelings it has to convey.     We @MONTH1 discard the world's greatest novel because of racial discrepancies or wizardry. We @MONTH1 throw away a moving song because of its lyrics. We @MONTH1 trash a movie after only reading the title, never even giving it a chance. How fair is this? Even now there @MONTH1 be those who refuse to read your newspaper because of their disagreements with one, individual editor. That is no fair crop in my right mind.     I implore you, as a public, as people of sound mind and stout hearts to reconsider the censorship of those works which have a clear and true message and were forged for the benefit of our humankind. All things have a story to tell. A friend of mine once said to me, that there were three ways we could absorb things that we find undesirable. We can reject, we can ignore, or we can absorb and interpret. To reject leaves you no smarter. To ignore leaves you in fear. However, to absorb, you gain new knowledge, be it of a new culture or new person. Everything must be taken with a grain of salt. Let us watch something we find immoral and then take the time to understand why it is immoral, for it is these things that define us. If you do not see what is or is not right, who is to say what is truly ethical? We need material of substance in our libraries, for our exposure and for our fathoming of new knowledge in our modern world	5
3729	Dear Newspaper;     In libraries I do not feel it is neccasry to take stuff away that poeple could find offensive, because honestly if it offends you than don't look at it. You are your own person and can make your own decisions, if this so called offensive material is not veiwed offensive by someone. Then why should that person be  punished by someone who has to make a big deal out of something. Just because you don't like it doesn't mean I don't like it.          If someone finds a book offensive then don't read it, if there is a magazine that you find offensive, don't read it. It is as simple as that, people are wise enough to know what is good and what is bad for them. There is no reason why someone can't choose what they want to get, where they want it. From observations of my own I have seen numerous times when someone has found someones music offensive, but they don't say anything. They just ignore it, the world needs more people like that. More people who will stand up for what they believe in and won't judge others for what they belief in.     It seems as if the world is becoming filled with a bunch of people who care way to much about what other people are doing. That is not a bad thing nessaccarily but everyone will be offended by something but it is your choice to whether or not let it bug you for the rest of your life. Listen to what ever music, read what ever books or magazines that you want. If someone finds them offensive, so be it. You are your own person and that won't ever change. Do what makes you happy and nothing else.	3
3147	IN MY OPINION I THINK THAT SOME BOOKS PROBABLY SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM THE SHELVES IF SOME OF THE BOOKS AREW FOUND OFFENSIVE. SOME OF THE MOVIES AND BOOKS PEOPLE FIND OFFENSIVE CAN BE PRETTY BAD AND SAY NASTY THINGS AND STUFF LIKE THAT.      SOME MUSIC CAN BE PRETTY OFFENSIVE TOO BECAUSE IT CAN SAY NASTY THINGS AND THINGS LIKE THAT BUT NOT ALL MUSIC IS BAD.. IT DEPENDS ON THE KIND OF MUSIC YOU LIKE TO LISTEN TO IF IT SAYS NASTY THINGS BECAUSE THERE IS MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF MUSIC TO LISTEN TOO.	2
3869	I believe that it is unnecessary to remove items off shelves for offensive reasons. I feel this way for several reasons, but three in particular. First, it @MONTH1 be a book, movie, or magazine that someone plans on reading, and removing an item will let down the customer. Second, @CAPS1 are many solutions to try out before taking an item away. Last, customers have to accept some decisions a business decides to make.     First, it @MONTH1 be a book, movie, or magazine that someone plans on reading, and removing an item will let down the customer. People come to libraries to look at what they're interested in to entertain themselves. @CAPS1 should be all types of literation in the library for all types of people, because everyone doesn't think alike. Everytime an item is removed off of a shelf, @CAPS1 will be an unsatisfied customer.     Second, @CAPS1 are many solutions to try out before taking an item away. Libraries always have some type of organization. In order to not offend anyone, items should be divided into their own categories inside their own sections. This solution will prevent anyone from seeing something that offends them. If that doesn't help, librarians should post a sign stating what type of objects are inside on the front door, so everyone knows before they enter.    Last, customers have to accept some decisions a business decides to make. A customers' needs and wants should be met at all times, unless a customer is trying to run the business as if it was their own. If a particular library chooses to have certain types of items, because they know what what readers' like, then no one else should involve theirself. If I owned a library, I would be upset if a customer removed a book off a shelf, because they would be interfering with my business.     In conclusion, I beleve it is unnecessary to remove items off shelves for three reasons. First, it @MONTH1 be a book, movie, or magazine that someone plans on reading. Second, @CAPS1 are many solutions to try out before taking an item away. Last, customers have to accept some decisions a business decides to make. I believe I expressed my opinion to the fullest. Although some people @MONTH1 disagree with the way I feel, I'm sticking with it. @CAPS1 defintly wouldn't be any books left for any of us if items were removed for offensive reasons.	3
3597	Some people think that offensive books should be off the selves, but some other people think that this should not be allowed.     I do not believe that certain materials (books, movies, and magazines.  If we take evey book off the self then we would not have any book to read.  If we start taking offensive books off the self then every body coming in would be taking @NUM1 books off the self.  Then with in two days there would be not books left.     If we do not have any books then are eyes would be bad. We should not take books off the selves because of some people like to read.  If people do not like the books in the library then they should not go to the library to get books.     This is why people should not take offensice books off the selves. This will make peoples eyes so bad that they would not see good at all.	2
3915	Certain material such as books, movies, and magazines should not be removed from libraries. The quote by Katherine Paterson simply states that if everyone had  the right to remove a book from a shelf, then we would have no books left on the shelf for any of us. The world would be empty because there is always something that a person sees as offensive.      To each person that finds the material offensive, there are always ten people who do not find it offensive at all. A person's beliefs can cloud their views on things like religion. There are so many wrong things out in the world that you can never do right by.      In places like libraries, you never know who might come in to check something out. That is why it is recommended to make sections in the library. Adult novels, childrens book, science finction novels all in different sections of the library. This would make a parent cautious of where their child goes. If a child walks into the wrong sections, there is only one person to blame; the parent. Children always wander off into random places because of curiousity. Parents have to make sure that nothing horrific happens such seeing something that a  toddler or a teenager is not supposed to see.      One object, such as a book, a movie, or a magazine, can teach a person millions of lessons. If those lesson are not tought yet, they will be tought later. In a harder way. The person might have to live the lesson to learn it. That is why some material should not be taken away.      Everyone believes in different things. There is always someone that has a different opinion of things. The world contains of many things that people find offensive, but it does not mean those things have to go. There is always a choice of what to do and what not to do. Someone has to find a way to fix things and in a good kind of way where people can find peace with themselves and others. Removing material from libraries can cause many things; approval, disapproval, anger, and happiness. Most of all, it can cause fights, which later on can turn into war. The material in our libraries is meant to teach people about life, and people find that wrong, then it means they do not experience life	3
4248	Everyone loves to take their little children to the library and pick out all kinds of book to to read, but what if your child picks up that one book that, lets say just isn't want you want them reading. Then what do you do? Take the book from them? Look for more and just let it let? Well you cannot blame the library for having the book. Or say you see books you do not like on the shelve at @ORGANIZATION1. Not only books but music or movies. Even if you find it offensive, someone else might not. It should not be a big issue at all because not everyone thinks alike, some of those books, music, or movies could have great information for others, and also every book, music, or movie has its purpose. Although you @MONTH1 not see it everytime it is something that you do not like.     Wow, the world would be SO boring if everyone liked the same music, read the same books, or just watched the same movie over and over again. Eveyone has the right to chose what they like and enjoy watching, reading or listening to. The libraries and stores also should have the right to put whatever they want on their shelves. Yes, somethings are not approite for others, such as yonuger kids but it does not matter. You as a parent should do your best to keep them away from those things you do not want them to see or hear.     Another thing is that just because you do not like something or think it is stupid does not mean that another person does not love it! Not your averge teenage girl is going to want to read about building a house or listen to music from the @NUM1's, but does that mean that stores should not sale them? Everyone has a different taste, just like in music. Most younger kids these days are starting to listen to the fast rap music. That their parents swear up and down you cannot understand. Although in relatity some of those songs have great meaning to us teenagers.     Lastly every song, book, or movie has a meaning. Not everyone will see the meaning but it is there. Everyone has their own opinoin. Librarys or stores should not take things off their selves just because one person thinks that it is unapporite.	4
3533	Should books, music, movies, and magazines that are offensive to public be removed? No,  I strongly disagree.           Should books that @MONTH1 be offensive to others no because there are hundreds and thousands of different books and even more. All books have different themes and subjects and all readers have different opinions on them. For example say there is a book about abortions and you want to know more about this subject so you deside to check it out. In the line behind you is a women who tells you not to purchase this book because she disagrees with killing a baby and tells the owner to cancel this book for that reason. No this would not happen just because someone hates or dislikes something it could very well be something someone loves and enjoys.     Here are some reasons why you would agree to removing somethings off the shelves like sex. Things such as sex @MONTH1 offend people because you @MONTH1 beileve it promotes sex to young teenagers or young kids but thats not the case. Most books on sex teaches you the right and wrong things to do and how to stay self. People need to understand that @PERCENT1 of teens world wide are sexually active and books that @MONTH1 help you to protect yourself and others.      In conclusion there are many people that @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not like the books or other things that they find offensive but every one has there opinion. You cant take things away just because of one person that would not be far to a individual with a problem that is seeking help or information on there personal problem. For these reasons I disagree with taking away items that @MONTH1 be offensive to others because everyone is different in this world and that should not change because of a disagreement or opinion someone has on you.	4
3747	I believe that books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be removed from the library shelves. If the materials propose things like racism, I would like those items taken off the shelves. Sometimes politics have a say in this. This is my say on this topic.     First off, people have an option of looking at those things on the shelves or on the internet. All of us have our own opinion about what is offensive and what is not offensive. Lots of people have families and kids and they don't want their kids to have to see that kind of stuff. The parents have the knowlegde of where most of the materials in libraries are. Also if the parents want to get books, why not go to a different library and get books. Or go to a store that sells books and is a little more censored. I only have one execption though, if the materials in the book, music, movie, magazine is racist in anyway, I would want that removed from the shelf.     Many people have the choice of wheather or not to go to a place that has offensive materials. Sometimes the local, state or even the federal government have a say in wheather or not this kind of material gets put on the shelves of libraries or on the internet. Who knows, maybe someone likes these kinds of books, music, magazines, movies etc., and they don't want them takin off the the shelves or off the internet. Even going on the computer and 'surfing the web' for stuff like that is a little bit crazy, but thats their choice. So thats my view on the censorship in libraries.	4
4153	I don't think that certain books or anything should be taken away because people like different stuff. Someone might have wanted to get that book. I don't think it would be right to take it away.      When I was in sixth grade, I was in a foster home that I hated. They would not let me listen to the music I liked. They thought it was bad for kids to listen to. All they wanted me to listen to was christian music and I did not like that.      My old foster parents used to try and take the stuff from me that they thought was the 'devil' in me. They would make me read the bible everynight. They tried to shove religion down my throat. I think maybe that is one reason I am not religious. They would not even let me listen to this one band because they had a song out about this girls husband having an affair on her.      Everyone should have their own opinion and be able to choose what they like or what they listen to or watch. When parents are that strict, it usually makes the kids want to do whatever they tell them not to do. If you don't let someone watch, listen to, or read what they want, then it might not be very easy for them to express themselves. They would not be able to show off what they really like. They would be doing something that they don't even like and That is not right. Everyone should be able to express themselves and what they like.	3
4047	As the Katherine Paterson's quote states everyone in fact has the right to take books, movies, magazines and other items off the shelves if deemed offensive or inappropriate. However this should be their decision and only their's; not other parents rallying together to get their desired results; the removal of certain books.      In todays times so much is viewed as offensive or inappropriate that wasn't when the previous generations read them. When parents read these things today they feel these items are inappropriate versus when they were teenagers they felt it was appropriate. Of course in todays technological age kids can lay their hands on just about anything if they know how to.      So, if parents begin censoring items there is one incentive or reason for them to read or listen to it; and disobey parents. They also get receive an unconventional or unintended education. So if parents censor the kids have been given a multitude of reasons to go against their parents wishes and read or listen to it anyway. So that is why parents shouldn't censor what their kids read, listen to, or see because eventually they will see it. Do you want that?	3
3235	Why Censorship @CAPS1 @CAPS2?     In our everyday lives, we come across many things that can be taken to offense.  Some of these things we might not even realize, but they're out there.  Everybody doesn't want there children getting into the wrong things early on, but we know it will eventually happen.  We just have to teach our kids what @CAPS1 good and what @CAPS1 @CAPS2.  This goes for literary items too.  We need to have faith in our kids that they will do what @CAPS1 right.  I think that when old enough, they should be able to read books and listen to music that might be offensive.  I think we shouldn't get rid of all the offensive material at the libraries.     Now days, there @CAPS1 a lot of hard work that goes into music, movies, and books.  If we start getting rid of all the offensive material, many people will be offended that in itself.  The people that worked on the movie or wrote that book put a lot of time and effort into the piece.  They spent countless of hours working with others just to get the piece into publication, or trying to get somone to film their movie idea.  I think that it would be wrong to outrule peices of great literature because behind every one of them, there @CAPS1 a person that put a lot of effort into that material.     In every book you pick up today, you could look through it and find a offensive language or offensive gestures in it.  The @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS1 a very detailed book and has many great facts in it, but many people find it offensive because it says @PERSON2 had a wife and had children.  This book isn't telling you what to believe or what actually happened, it @CAPS1 just a story full of conspiracy theories.  You can still believe what you want and read this book.  A movie that could be considered offensive just by the title @CAPS1 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 Can't @CAPS8.  Many people hear this title and @MONTH1 not want to watch it, thinking that it will discriminant against @CAPS6 people, but instead it @CAPS1 a very good movie about a group of people that play basketball.  Many things have offensive language but that doesn't mean we can't act like adults, read these books, and realize that they are just stories.  They are not telling you what to believe and what not to believe.     In our country today, we have many different ethnic groups, and many people think differently about things.  In our society we are given the right to have our own opinion about things, and we are able to like what ever we want.  Even though literary might be offensive, some people like reading books like this.  If I look in the library, I could find a book with offensive material, but the book could still be a very good book.  Even though it @CAPS1 disrcimanting against me, I could still love the book.  There @CAPS1 always controversy in our society, and almost everyone loves it.  Why get rid of these books when people are still enjoying them everyday.     Like Katherine Paterson said, if she has the right to take a book off of the shelf, then so does everyone else.  If we let everybody take books off the shelves, then there will be none left.  We cannot control everything that people do.  Taking offensive books out of the library will not stop people from reading them, but this will decline the library usage, and people will slowly stop reading.  If they don't like the books at the library, then they won't have problem with not reading at all.  I think that censorship in our libraries would be a @CAPS2 idea, and I think we should definitely not take out all the offensive material in the libraries	4
3527	There are plenty of books that people don't want their children reading. Books such as '@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @PERSON1' is a book I had read and it was very out there and straight forward. But I would have to disagree I think those books deserve to be read. It shows kids that not everything is perfect.      People complain about how they think books are bad or things people say on @CAPS3 or in music is bad but if you don't want to listen to them, don't let your kids listen to it. If parents are so worried about what kids are reading or learning because of the world we live in now, lock them up. But I do have to agree with one thing, there are alot of bad things in muic and magazines but I think it can be avoided and not be caused to crupt a kid. I'm very into music and some music I dont listen to because of the things in it but I dont let that music or magazines change my option on things. I dont think people should be able to take books of the shelfs becaue it doesnt give other students or people to read them. Some people get inspired by books about drugs, not like to use them but to know that there are people out there that have overcome stitutions just like them. I like reading books about teenage problems and like to know all the different ways people have overcome them and see how they live. If people can get offended off of a book or movie I don't think they have a right to take that away. I think people that feel offended by books, magazines, and movies should stay away from them if they are offensive to them, because everyone has an option and not everyone thinks the same things.      With all the bad or good movies or books out there, I'm certain someone at least feels offended by one or two books or movies but that isn't a reason to want to take it down. Because once you do that someone will take a book you thought wasn't offensive and it will make you mad. I think if people stayed away from things that offended them and stayed close to books that they liked we wouldn't have much of a conflict unless you get that picky, always wanting to start a fight person to find something else to be picky about with the books or magazines or movies	4
4614	Offensive articles and or movies and magazines etc should not be pulled from shelves.  If individuals choose to read and/or watch the material that is their personal choice  @CAPS1 I think there should be an age limit for the material.  If individuals find the material offensive they should turn their back and not read or watch the programs.  If the items are in a public library they should be kept in a separate area for those who wish to view them.   They should not be kept in the open for small children or for people who do not wish to see them.        Historic material such as diaries and accounts of events should be held at federal libraries.   Having these documents in a public library could interest small children in reading  things that are inappropriate for them.   Certain items such as magazines, and newspapers and books, some of these items are held at a public level.   Governement affiliated documents should be held at a federal library such as parts of history and important documents.   High profile documents such as the constitution should be held in high security areas.        In conclusion people who wish to view certain material should be able to do so as I had previously stated.   They should not be out in the open for small children.   It should be held in a separate area   If people do not wish to view this material they simply do not go in that area.    Having an age limit in place for this material is key so that small children do not view it and get the wrong message.   Having certain doements in public and certain documents in federal libraries is a factor.   Certain historical doeuments and other items that are affiliated with the government should be held at a federal level as well as important documents related to the country.  These documents should be high profile secure areas	3
4605	Hello I am kristin, I am here to tell you why we should take some magazines out of our public libraries. Now I dont know if you have heard about @CAPS1 the magazine or @CAPS2 magazine. But I have and I also use to read them. In some of thouse issues are sex tips.           Now if I was a mother and my child ran up to me beging me to let them cheek that thing out I would look at them and say no. They dont need to undestand sex untill they are in there teens or atleast thirteen or fourteen. A child shouldnt be able to even go near that area they should only be able to go near the children's section.           Some parents think like me and agree with the fact that a child shouldn't learn about sex. But others are like why not they are going to know about it in @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and when they are married also.           There are also some other things that need out of a librarie. Some music might not be the best choice for a young child. Like for example rap music. It has allot of cussing in it and talking about sex. Some of the things said in a rap song are shorty let me rind you like a huricain. Thats just like saying hey chick lets do it for the heck of it. Thats not what I want my kid to listen to. I want my child to listen to stuff that says hey lets go outside and camp or duck duck gusse.              Some movies are okay to watch with your kids as long as its not over @NUM1. But if it is they can't watch it. I'll give you another example my little neice is probubly around the age of ten or so. She watche's @CAPS5 @CAPS6 but only with her parents inthe same room as her. She can not watch it by herself or she will get grounded.      This is why some of the stuff should be taken out of our public Libraries	3
3553	Libraries have always had interesting materials, such as, books, music, movies, and magazines, and there always will be. Libraries are one of the best places to find those materials.          I do not believe that libraries should have to remove those materials from their shelves because maybe some people find them interesting? Thats all that libraries like are people interested in reading their books. If some people find different books offensive then they shouldn't go near those books. If they have a complaint then they should just keep it to themselves and not ruin the chance for others to check them out.     Libraries shouldn't have to take certain material out of there shelves because some people don't like them, its your choice to read that book, nobody is making you read something that makes you feel uncomfortable. Now say if there were a numerous amount of people that take offense to the materials in the library, then the library could decide whether they want to or not, but they still dont need to be told what to do. Its their business and they decide what materials stay and which ones go.     If I was one of those who took offense to a book in the library then i would just keep it to myself. I wouldn't like to go through all of that trouble of arguing and complaining just becouse of one book. Think of others before you think of yourself sometimes and what their interests are. Thats less trouble you will have to go through later on in life.	3
4529	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 Newspaper @CAPS4,        the artedclie that you writte last week really get to me. The one about do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive to some people. i went back and fore on this, first i was thinking that if it was offensive to some people  then we sould take it down bucese if it offensiveds people then why are we selling it to the people, but then i get to thinking agian and  i was like people have the right to freedom of space and if this how they what to talk then let them space there mind.     this great courtry of ares was made on the right that every one is made the same and every one inteialed to the freedom of space. if people what to talk like thet do in there music or act they way they what to in there movies its there life if yuo dont like it dont buy it are even pay an attient to it.say if i was a raper like lil wayne or some one like that i would care about the people who are talking the way they are bucese it is my way of tilling the world how i feel about thing that are on my mind.if some one writtes some thing in a book that you dont like dont go all out and go on tv shows to make fun or till how you feel writte i letter to the author and till them how yuo feel about the topic.     every person black, white, yellow, brown, or even green has the right to freedom of space. was give to us for a ressen and i think it was for that even if you have idia but you think it is supted just say it bcuese some people think that is amazing or not. but every one is created the same so treat people the way you wont to be treated. i would like to thank you for reading this. your artedcile really open my eyes to the world and how i sould see it. thank you for writting it.                                                                   sincely,                                                              @PERSON1	3
4686	What do you want your children to be able to see in their public library? As we all know, there are things like books, picture, and movies that we do not want our younger generation to see. This is @CAPS1 parents are so carful with computers, and what their children have access to.      Every situation has it's pros and cons, but in @CAPS2 cases if you analize the pros and cons you can come to an accurate conclusion. When you go to a library with your children, the children run off to do what they want, usually to the children's section. Let's face it, children do not want to look at adult book. Once children learn to read you might come across a bigger problem. As children get older they want to be able to do more things, like watching older movies, reading harder books, and look at want they want on the computer.      I'm sure that the first thing that might come to mind is to censor the library, take away the horror films, the banned books excetra. This might be fine at first, but what about the adults that have every right to read and watch whatever they want. The library is free, does this mean that if our society does not like a book, movie, or magazine taht the adults must go somewhere else to pay for a particular book or movie as apposed to borrowing if for free at the public library. It could work, but if a child is going to look at bad things at a library what will stop him/her from looking at them at a bookstore?           Another issue is banned books. @CAPS2 of them are classics that past generations have read in school. @CAPS1 would we decide to take these books away now? It makes it seem like the younger generations can not handle it, or that past generations have something to hide. The definition of a classic is a piece of writing that has stood the test of time. Does it just end here and now? @CAPS1 would we take the classics away? Let's face it, if the classics are not read in school today, and they are not read in the next generations what is stopping them from being forgetten? Some banned books parents will look at and say, '@CAPS1 would this be banned? I do not remember anything bad in it.' @CAPS2 of the time the classic banned books were written some time in the @DATE1, @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 or the @CAPS6 @CAPS7. Society was different then. When you read a classic it acts as a history book to show us how it was to live during the time it was written. Usually the book will be banned because of bad language which people thing should be taken out of our schools, but they are missing the point. That was how things were back then so, who are we to hide it?      Does this mean that I think anything and everything should be put in our public libraries? Not at all. Some magazines can be avoided, or be put in a section away from younger children's eyes. Horror movies do not have to be taken out completly, just put in a different section. If parents are worried about monetering their children on the internet there is nothing stopping them from watching their children while they are using a computer.      I think that there can be come cesorship in libraries, but sometimes our society goes overboard. As long as we keep an open mind and make the right decisions for our future generations we can make our country a safe yet edjucational place to learn	4
3713	'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf..' said by Katherine Paterson. Books are used to entertain and even teach readers in certain aspects of life. Not exactly all books are offensive but some are. Those who are, should be taken off the shelfs, especially if it is in a school library. Children could take that offensive or violent book into action. Other children could show the book to other peers. And also, children can get very offended. Now should offensive books be taken off the shelfs?         Children nowadays are being motivated alot. Whether it's through television shows, video games, or even music. On the news, there has been reports about children being influenced to have a gun and hang themselves, etc. Books are meant to entertain readers in a good way and not teach them to become a violent person. Some readers who read such things can turn those words into action. Then the student could be in trouble. And people really wouldn't want that.          Children have a tendency of showing off to friends. If a student sees something offensive or violent on a book, there is a big chance that they will show it to their peers. Just because children think it's cool. Having one person read this could be a problem, now imagine having more than just one, a whole clique seeing this. It could end up in a huge problem, not only for the children and their parents, but also for the school. The children learning these new things from the book can cause the children to use everyday and make it popular. The school can have a bad image from the students. Passing on the information can become a conflict, and people certainly do no want that.           School is not only a teaching building, but also a social place. There are cliques in every school. Within the each person there is a different color, religion, style, and personalities. Children can be easily hurt. If books are being offensive, it can just easily hurt anyone reading that book. Once again, books are meant to entertain readers and not to hurt them. So why even have authors write something offensive in their books? Maybe authors feel the need to add interest in the book and suspense, but not all readers would take it easily. Hurting people isn't a fun thing to do, and people certainly do not want to do that.               So why have offensive books in shelfs? These books can cause children to use it in action, to show it off to other peers, and to hurt them as well. Children nowadays have it hard on themselves, why make it harder. Books are meant to entertain readers, why not just do that. So yes, take the offensive books off and there will be no problems.	4
3760	There are so many resaons why taking a book, movie, or anything else off the shelves is wrong. If it is violent or sexual i can see why it shouldn't be on the shelves but if the reader doesn't like the book or movie, then don't read it or watch it find something else.     If everyone took a book of the shelf that they didn't like then what would we have to read because everyone has a book or two that they don't like or think is offensive. Every book can't be perfect for that person. Everyone has there own veiws on books wether they like it or dislike it. If that book isn't what your looking for then put it back and stop reading it.     There have been many of people say 'If you don't like it then don't listen to it'. They are excaclly right because if there is something that you can't stand to listen to or read and you do it anyway thats going to make you mad. Then your going to complain that it is on the shelfs and say it is bad and it shouldn't be on the shelves anymore. That is what starts all these things of people saying it is offensive. People know what they like and don't like, so if there is something that you don't like then don't listen to it or read it.      It all comes down to common sence. We all have it we just need to start using it. That means if you like country music then don't listen to hard rock or rap because that isn't what you like so don't listen to it. Because if you listen to it then your like why is that stuff on the shevles for people to listen to it's bad for you it is puting bad thought into those teenager's heads. If eveyone sticks to doing what they like and don't worry about the other stuff then eveyone will be fine.	4
4623	In my life time I have been to many libraries. I also seen many diffrent catagories of books suck as comedy, fiction, non-fiction, drama, and etc. As we all know there are many topics out thier that is not suitable for minors or suitable for many other ages.     Movies in this time and age reveal to much for you eyes. For example in cartoons their are sexual content such as kissing .Some parents don't want their child expose to the kind of activity yet. Movies somtimes put false beliefs in peoples mind about the way things are, going to be,or the why you sould see it.Their are also some good movies place in libraries such ass docomentries, history , biography, and etc. Thats gives you good insite on how things was and hoe things are now.     Another topic is magazines. Its strange things going on in the world that @CAPS1 sould be aware of the why we put them in magazines but children have easy access to them in libraries. Picture that magzines have are images that sould be places in some magazines. As there are bad things there are also good that come from magazine. Magazines are in some ways just as useful as books. They carry very helpful information.     Music is aslo a big topic thats placed in libraries. Some of the lauguage thats is place on  cd tracks are good BUT  theirs alot of bad material that on them also. So many people out the known as @CAPS2 say some very harsh and profaine words that many and children sould just not want to hear. Like I said before as their is bad thier is much good. We have gospel , jazz, @CAPS3&@CAPS4, and etc that many people enjoy listing to.     In conclusion thier are many things good that belongs in libraries but also many bad. Libraries in my opinion sould take more caution on what people have access to. Very easy a young child (that can read) can pick up a adult book go sit in a corner read and be expose to most things parents are expose to. So in my opinion yes certin things should be removed from the shelves if the are found offensive.	4
3405	We see them. We read them. We gossip about them. Books that are found with inapropriate language, pages with the word 'sex' on them, disturbing thoughts and ideas, cuss words, its all there, but yet they are still in our libraries. My views on censorship is that, yes, our libraries should be more modest and not have books on the shelves with these things in them. The  books in libraries across the @LOCATION1 that have found and profane ideas in them, is one of the direct faults in our teenagers today.     In my personal experience with this, i have come across books that have had inapropriate language in them. I have also read books assigned to me at school that have had descriptions of sex and bad language in them as a third grader. As a young boy, I would go home to my parents and show them the content of the book and how despiteful it was. I've always been raised in a @CAPS1 home and seeing these things not only in schools, but on the bookshelves in libraries I believe is un-called for. I know that there are so many things that could offend people. Rascism, sex, cussing, rules, religion, but you need to eliminate the main things. It is impossible to please everyone. These ideas in magazines, books, in movies, and even in music has changed the world upside down. Even when I was young, we were taught no cussing aloud, and yet you see this all the time in books.     In @LOCATION2, of course we have the freedom to do what we want. Authors have the right to put profane language in their books, and even dirty ideas. However, libraries are not forced to keep this content in their libraries across the globe. I believe that we should keep the future of @LOCATION2 in the back of our minds, that if we teach them this material, they are going to grow up in the world with no morals at all, and the world will become worse than it already is.      In the quote by Katherine Paterson, I believe that she has made a strong point. If we take the books off of shelves, then our students, children, grandchildren won't be taught properly, and then there would be no education at all. However, I believe that from this quote even she agrees we in @LOCATION2 fear what our children read. So yet, why do we keep these books in our libraries? I believe that if we take these certain books, magazines, movies, songs, and internet sites off the computers, and out of libraries and schools, teenagers wouldn't be traveling down the road they are.     Today, the world has turned to a disaster. The kids we saw @NUM1 years ago were on the right path. Now those same kids are smoking pot, having sex, getting girls pregnant, abortions, miscarriages, things that are not appropriate. And I truly believe that this content students read in schools and libraries across @LOCATION2 has something to do with it all. It is now in the hands of the @LOCATION3, whether our kids grow up to be the future of @LOCATION2, or the joke of @LOCATION2. We need this fixed	3
3351	When it comes to censorship I believe that very few things should be removed. Just because it is found offensive by some does not mean it is offensive to all. A material should only be removed if and only if that material offends an over ruling majority of people. If you find it offensive just ignore it you don't have to buy it. Maybe somebody else finds it interesting and it comtains the information that they have been seeking.     When it comes to books, music, movies or magazines I believe almost anything should be allowed except for material that depicts nudity or drugs and alcohol. Other than that a little cursing here and there and some violence is perfectly acceptable, but it should probably be kept from small children if it's to bad. Usually if a child is exposed to that type of material they usually grow up believing that whatever they saw as a child is completly acceptable. Sometimes it's violence sometimes it's other things like drugs or alcohol, whatever the case @MONTH1 be.      Many parents believe that certain material should be banned because it exposes their child to bad morals. But my belief is that if your a good parent then shouldn't have to worry about that type of stuff. If you really do not want your child to be of any part of it then take actions to do such. For example if you don't want your child watching a certain television show then block it. Don't just think they won't watch it and then when they do you get mad at the people who created the show. It's not their fault maybe you as a parent should have made sure in the first place that your child did not see that material.     There are some people out there that believe that if any material depicts anything bad then it should be removed. But what I believe is that this is @LOCATION1 and people can read and write whatever they want, and if you have something to say about it then that's fine by me you can believe whatever you would like to believe. People should be able to keep their freedom of speech and be creative without being ridiculed by people	4
4217	Censorship is the most foul and terrifying part of society.  Our lives have been taken over by politcal correctness, so much so that our voices are no longer our own.  Until recently we had the freedom to convey our thoughts, no matter what those thoughts were, in any form of media.  But now if something is found to be offensive in any way it is essentially burned.  Censorship limits our freedoms, takes away our @CAPS2 as citizens and people, shields us from the truths of the world, and limits the knowledge we can take from, as well as ensuring that one day there will be nothing left of media.     The @CAPS1 of @CAPS2, the document that our country lives by, says that we as people have the right of free speech.  Censorship actively and violently violates that right.  Our country was built on free speech, and now it is being taken away.  Our own words forced down our throats, never allowed to come out.  Censorship ensures that no opinions will be heard, that no one's beliefs will be questioned, that no one can assume or think for themselves.  Is this not what we are supposedly guaranteed by freedom of speech?  We are supposed to be able to say anything we want to say.  We know there are consequences for saying certain things, but we are supposed to be allowed to say them.  Letting our own ideas into the world allows for new ideas to form.  Arguements come, but these arguements allow people to see other ideas that they hadn't thought of and look at issues from new perspectives.  We are able to see our world through different eyes when we hear or read someone else's opinions.  And from there we can form our own opinions, allowing our world to be rich with iddeas and knowledge, and allowing our society to advance.  But censorship wants to take this all away from us in order to please everyone.  But there will always be someone who is unhappy.  It's the inevitable truth.     Censorship is trying to shield us from the ugliness of this world.  In a way this makes sense.  We don't want our children to understand the atrocities that happen in everyday life.  We don't want them knowing what's happening behind closed doors.  However, if we don't allow people to open these doors, they can never understand the world or be prepared for the experiences that are to come.  Learning the harsh realities of our society educates people, allowing them to stop these realities as well as be prepared for when they happen to them.  For example, let's look at the issue of rape.  Rape is a horrible thing, but it happens.  It is a nasty part of reality.  Rape can be censored from books, televsion, and other forms of media.  We can walk around pretending rape doesn't exist.  But that doesn't accomplish anything.  That doesn't get rid of rape.  It still exists.  And if the people are uneducated on the issue of rape, how will it ever stop?  How will a rape ever be able to be prevented?  How will someone know what to expect or what to do?  By censoring rape from media, we are ensuring that the people in future generations never learn about rape.  Knowledge of rape is important if it is ever going to be stopped.  Pretending something doesn't exist doesn't get rid of it.  Censorship is supposed to protect the people, but it doesn't.  It hurts the people, cutting off their access to knowledge.     We as people need knowledge.  We live off of knowledge.  And the way we obtain this knowledge is through media.  Censorship takes away pieces of knowledge gradually.  It @MONTH1 not seem like a lot is missing now, but as time goes on the gap will increase, and more knowledge will be taken from our grasp.  Is this fair?  Is this right?  Is this helping us?  How does cutting out knowledge ever help?  It brings us backwards in time, makes us fear.  It is human nature to fear the unknown.  The more that becomes unknown, the more we have to fear.  Censorship is taking away crucial pieces of knowledge that we must understand to get along in society.  This is wrong and immoral.  It is unfair, if nothing else.  We should be allowed to take from any knowledge that exists.  No good comes from hiding it.     Lastly, this gradual burning of knowledge is affecting society in horrid ways.  And as time goes on it can only get worse.  Censorship is based off of offensiveness.  If something could be offensive, it is disposed of.  However, everything that exists in society could be offensive to someone.  Therefore everything and everyone should be censored in order to fulfill the goal of censorship.  This means all media of any kind should be destroyed.  No one should say anything.  The world would be forced to be silent.  All knowledge would be taken away.  Chaos would ensue.  The people's freedom would be completely taken away.  The freedom to know would vaporize right in front of their eyes.  This is our future if we allow the censorship to continue.  We cannot allow our lives to be taken over by censorship.  Yes, people's feelings will be hurt, but we cannot rid our world of ideas and knowledge purely to spare feelings.  These ideas and knowledge are too important to let censorship take away.     Censorship is taking away our freedoms and @CAPS2, slowly stealing them away from us.  It also tries to shield us from reality, but instead hurts us, ensuring that we will never understand our world and never be able to stop the very things that are being censored.  Censorship is affecting society, ensuring that our freedoms are to be taken away.  All knowledge will be trashed and no one will be able to voice their opinions.  A very dark future waits for us if censorship continues.  Only by helping people to understand censorship and the wrong it does to society can we gain back our freedom of speech; the freedom we are supposedly guaranteed, but censorship is desperately trying to take away.	6
3381	I do not think that books should be taken off shelves just because it's offensive or because others don't like it. If everyone took the books, music, and movies off the shelves that they didn't like, then all that would be left would be empty bookshelves.     I believe that the library was a right to keep whatever they want on the shelves. Some @MONTH1 say that the library has inapproprite books to check out, or they don't want their kids to pick up a book they don't like and read it. I think that's why the library has the shelves marked in sections for example, adult, young adult, children, and referance.      I've never seen a book that was offensive to me in a libray, which brings me to another point. Everyone has a opinion, if a book is offensive to you it might not be offensive to someone else. For example say that you saw a book on animal mating and you thought it was a bad book for the libary to have because, little kids might pick it up. Well that is your opinion because, if a biology teacher seen a book like that then they might want to check it out.      Another thing is that the library has certain book for a reason. Say that there is a book in the library that is about slaves, this book might be offensive to @CAPS1 @CAPS2 but, this book is there to inform people about slavery. What is offensive to some isn't offensive to others.     In conclusion, I believe that books should not be taken off library shelves just because it is offensive to you. Everyone just has to remember that people have their own opinions about things and you just have to deal with it. That's why I think that books should not be tooken off shelves	3
3283	i think that the libraries in generally shouldn't take themusic,movies, or the magazines away. Because you never know what goes on at there home and they just want to get   away and relax the self at the library to read. I think that they shouldn't take the books off the the shelves just for a reason because people love going to the library.And if they don't have those things then what the point of going there.my other thing that they shouldn't take those things away is thatthey will not make a profit. when the people go to the libraryand they dont see those things they are going to wonder want happen.i think that it shouldn't be the children fault that all of the books are gone. It should be the owners and the people that work at the library fault that they made them take the booksoff the shelves.I also think that when the children goes to the library they are going to ask there parent or someone.Where are the book because they want to read and also where are the book so they can check them out.But the people would want to keep getting the books from the library to check them out.I think that the people should not take the books off the shelves for a specific reason and that reason is that people and children would go like on a weekend to read if they dont have any of those things at home.My thing is that they shouldn't just remove anything at all because it going to be a big commotion. So  by removing all of  that would be sad because what if no one has no place to go and they are feeling loney and they want to go the library and read. but my whole point agbout it is that who came up with no books,music or magzines on the shelves.But i also think that if they did that in the real world. Then it would be terrible and a crisis to the people.I think that they should not do that because the people love to read listen to music and etc. I also think that they should not do that because people love going to to releave some stress that they might have and they jus want to go there.I also think that they might not do it anyways because they know the people love there jobs to not to.One of the things that i like is that when i go to the library it is nice and quiet and we can listen to our ipod or our @NUM1 player something like that.Some people just love to go so that they can see there friends and communicate with them to get on the computer. My reason is that they shouldn't do that is they can lose everything like there jobs and etc.	3
4744	I THINK THAT IF A BOOK IS FOUND OFFINSIVE THEN YOU SHOULDN'T READ IT. CAUSE WHAT IF SOMEONE ELSE LIKES THE BOOK, THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO READ THAT BOOK . MAYBE IT'S AN INSPIRATION TO THEM,MAYBE IT WILL DRIVE THEM TO ACCOMPLISH SOMETHING THEY WANT IN THIER LIFE.  WHEN SOMEONE WALKS INTO A LIBRARY NO ONE CAN TELL THEM WHAT TO GET THEY MAKE THAT DECISION THEMSELVES, SO WHEN A BOOK OFFENDS YOU MAYBE YOU SHOULD WRIGHT TO THE AUTHER AND TALK TO HIM\HER. ABOUT THEIR BOOK.  THINGS YOU COULD ACCOMPLISH BY WRIGHTING THE AUTHOR IS A LETTER IN THE MAIL STATEING THAT HE OR SHE IS SORRY FOR HURTING YOU WITH THEIR BOOK ,ANOTHER IS MAYBE A VISIT FROM THE AUTHOR IN PERSONSON TO TELL YOU THAT HE OR SHE IS SORRY FOR THE PAIN THAT HE OR SHE BOOK BROUGHT YOU. THAT'S WHAT I THINK. ALSO NO I DON'T THINK THAT THE BOOK/ BOOKS SHOULD BE TAKEN OFF THE SHELVESCAUSE MAYBE JUST MAYBE IT WILL MOTIVATE SOMEONE ELSE INSTEAD OF PUTTING THEM DOWN.                                            THE END.	2
4170	Today's books in are libraries are sometimes offensive. Yes, I know they are about thing that happen in history. Other books are not, some more than others. They are about killing, shooting, doing drugs,ect.      First, I don't want my children growing up thinking @CAPS2 okay to steal, do drugs, or anything of that sort. I'v seen books that have no meaning at all that should be in are libraries. The kids might think they are good books to read, I think other wise. Books that fourth graders read that have bad words in them.     Secondly, @CAPS1 are fun to read, i know they are. You have to look at it this way im of age to read those kind of books but, letting little kids read those books is not okay with me or other people. If it where up to me i would take some of the really bad books, music, movies, and magazines out. @CAPS2 not up to me, it takes more than one person to do that. It would'n be fair if it was all up to me because the person next to me might not think the way  i am.     Next, @CAPS2 okay to take a movie and watch it or even ask for some music to lesson to. As long as @CAPS2 okay to watch or lesson to. Im just saying what i think would be right. Not everone think's the same. People @CAPS3 @CAPS1 kids watch, and lesson to all kinds of music and movies. As long as @CAPS2 okay with the perant it should be okay.       Lastly, @CAPS3 kids be kids. Have them grow up the way they want to grow up. Yes, that might sound dumb to the next person but it sounds okay with me. At the end of the day you still get to teach them not to lesson or do that kind of stuff in the books.	3
3309	I beleive it is wrong to remove books from library shelves even if they are found offensive. I have three reasons to support this statement. These reasons are knowledge, different sections of the library, and freedom. I will explain these reasons below but before I begin I would like to add that most people want to censor things that they fear.     If a book is removed from a shelf because someone finds it offensive then the next person who comes along looking for that book can not access it. How is that fair? In life there are many things that can offend people but thats life, you have to learn to let those things go. Everyone has a right to form their own views and oppinions on things, but they can not if they do not read other people's oppinions. Reading expands our vacabulary, at any age. Just because you do not like something does not mean someone else also can not like it. You have to give them a chance to form an oppionion.     Library's are everywhere. If you are concerned about your children finding books that you do not want them to see then take them to a library with sections. All libraries are broken down in sections. Keep your children in the 'children' section and there should not be any concerns in that area. Once your children get older allow them to roam the library and develope an oppinion on what types of books they enjoy most.      We live in @LOCATION1, which since founded has been all about freedom. Some people do not have the money to buy books, or internet, So these people rely on public libraries. If they look for books and can not find a subject that interests them they will not read. They could even be looking for a specific book and not be able to find it because it was taken off the shelf. There is also a religion conflict. There are many different versions of the @CAPS1 but, many different religions. People come from all backgrounds so if they do not beleive in the @CAPS1 do we take that off the shelves too?      In closing I would like to add that I can also see why people would want to censor certain things. However most of the things people do not like to see are things they fear. These people can not hide from reality, not everything in the world is good, so let's not pretend everything is perfect and do our best to contribute to the wellness of society. What better way than letting everyone read whatever they wish	4
4624	Censorship in libraries is a very controversial topic that has conflicting views. One side, in favor of censorship, believes that some literary material contained within a library could be offensive to some, and that it should be removed or censored. The other side, in favor of free speech, believes that all literary material in a library should be kept, whether it is seen as offensive or not. Of these two sides of such a controversial issue, it is evident that censorship should not be instilled within libraries, because of the right to free speech, the true meanings and expressions must be upheld, and it would take the oppurtunity to read such a work truly from an interested reader.     The first reason why the censorship of literary materials within a library is an unjust endeavor is because of the right to free speech. This right belongs to all citizens of @LOCATION1, and shouldn't be taken away because one person @MONTH1 think something is offensive. I have observed that many people will often attempt to steal this right from people, and this instillation of censorship will do just that to the authors. This is the first reason why the censorship of literary materials within a library is an unjust endeavor.     The next reason why the censorship of literary materials within a library is an unjust endeavor is because this censorship @MONTH1 dull down the true meanings and expressive themes that literary works are meant to express. An example of a story that would suffer from censorship is the famous 'The @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION1.' Such a novel, though containing offensive language at times, would not read the same if such language was omitted and removed. Instead, @PERSON1's expressions within the story would be dulled down immensely and be nearly silenced. This is the next reason why the censorship of literary materials within a library is an unjust endeavor.     The last reason why the censorship of literary materials within a library is an unjust endeavor is because it removes the availability of the book from an interested reader. Many times I have seen people blatantly have a tantrum over an offensive literary work. I have been offended by things that I have read before, and instead of demanding its removal and crying for a less offensive substitute, I simply either stopped reading the work or read through it anyways. A person must know that the use of offensive language within literary works rarely is intended to attack the reader, but rather to strongly get a point across.  If a person finds the material too offensive to read, then they should simply stop and find a more suitable work. By remaining calm and passive about these things, it keeps the literary work on the shelves in its true form for other people who wish to read it.This is the last reason why the censorship of literary materials within a library is an unjust endeavor.     It is clearly evident that the removal or censorship of literary works in a library is a bad idea as a whole. The decision to censor literary works would be bad because it would strip the author's right to free speech, it would dull down the author's true meanings and expressions, and it would remove the oppurtunity to read such a work from an interested person. The removal or censorship of literary works would be a terrible decision that all would regret in the years to come. This is why the removal or censorship of literary works in a library is an unjust endeavor.	4
4019	The shelf is an object that holds many types of diffierent materials such as movies, books, magazines, and music. Its all media and entertainment. But not everyone likes the media because one or all of these materials @MONTH1 be offensive towards the foriegn and children.     Censorship in our libraries could get a little graphic and such. Yes we all the it in movies and music, but we do not want it in our libraries. A library is a place for study and learning for educational purposes. There are not for entertainment and things of that nature. Sometimes they could be a little fun but for the most part, people would like to take there children and show them something to help there minds focus on school. By all @CAPS1 rated @CAPS2 movies, dirty music, adult books and magzines should be taken off the shelves.      One day as I was in the state library looking on the shelves for a book on @LOCATION1 and its people. As I was reading the book, it said some very mean and offensive things about the @CAPS3 people. I thought to myself that this book should be takken of the shelves forever and never seen again. It shocked me that someone would put that book in a public library and let the foreign and others read it. After some people read about the @CAPS3 people; They had second thoughts and started get angey and disliking them for theses things and offensive comments made!     Magazines and movies should be taken of the shelves in the catagories in my opinion of the poeple in different countries and the way they live. That could be very sad for someone because they could of really went through everything in that movie or what ever that magzines says. Another reason censorship should be under control is the titles to these materials. If a child looks at an adult film and it happens to be for a child, wouldnt you think thats a little offensive? I know I would. There is no way I want my child watching some violet movie.      We have to think for our children and the people that come in form different countries when it comes to public libraries. If censorship is not observed carfully then we could make the foriegners very angry or make our children become very violet and reckless because of the films on the shelves, and the people that come in to our country would never come back if they picked up the book that they might of thought that was int interesting but turns out to be very offensive in there opinion. Censorship is very imprtant in libraries and on the shelves	3
3845	I think that if it is a problem for others and not all why can't we just seperate the things in sections. That way there would be no problems.    I mean, why change something if only a few people doesn't like something? Thats only goning to lead to a big conflict. Think about if we were to tr and give everyone what they want, @CAPS1 would that work out not good at all. So you should just limiy thing dow and put them in setions.	2
3458	Hello! My name is @PERSON1. I am writting to you @DATE1 because their is so much conflict on the issue of 'if materials in the library are offensive should they be removed from their shelves'. I know their are people that will agree or disagree but what i think they should do is leave them. Yes i said it they should stay wright where they are.     People all over this world get themselves worked up over all the little things in life but what we dont understand is their is always gonna be something in life we dont like and thats never going to change. Like this for example, people taking offense to materials in the library and wonting them to be removed. I mean come on people wake up and realize you are not always going to have things as you wont them theirs always going to be things you just have to deal with it.      I believe that these types of materials should stay wright where their at because people can over look them we just decied not to. We all make a big deal over something so small. People should just not look at it and move on dont sit their and fuss about it just turn around and walk away just because you dont like it dosent mean that others dont. Everybody in this world needs to see that their are things were not going to like but we have to get over them and move on. This will always happen and theirs nothing we can do about it.     All over the universe people @MONTH1 agree or disagree with what i have to say but its your perspective and what you think about it is your choice. I  will say though that they should stay but people need to get over themselves and see the truth in life and know that even though their are things we dont like dont sit their and argue about it just leave it and go your own way.     So this is my essay to you. People need to see their always not going to get what they want in life but they need to move on. Like this if you have a problem with the things around you such as taking offense to materials in the library and wonting them removed well sorry but no. learn to walk away from it because what you like @MONTH1 not be what others like and what they like @MONTH1 not be what you like we just have to go on with life leave it be because others oppinons @MONTH1 not match yours . Leave the materials alone because we as people need to see where not always going to get our way in life and to take hold of learning how to blow it off instead of making a big deal about something so little we could of walked away from	4
3758	The question is, should we censor materials in libraries if it is offensive?  In my opinion I dont think they should censor the material.  Some things that we read, see, and hear are just going to be offensive, and we cant control everything that offends us.     I do agree that people have freedom of speech, but not over everything.  People need to stop over reacting to something that might have been said @DATE1.  Some things just need to be left in the past and kept there.  For example, some @CAPS1 @CAPS2 are still upset over slavery, and that happened over a @NUM1 @DATE1 @DATE1.   Censoring certain things means that people are not going to learn from the mistakes of our pass.      We need to stop all this over protection in our libraries of all places.  Children need to know what has happened in our past to see what they can change in our future.  Why? Why is my only question to why the people want to censor material in the libraries.  Are they trying to keep their children from seeing it or just for their own selfish reasons?       My conclusion is that they should not censor material because it offends someone.  I have been offended by lots of things that I have read but I dont try to get them censored or removed from the place I read it.  Sometimes you just have to deal with things that you dont like or dont agree with sometimes.	3
3278	Everyone is different and unique in the world and they have their own unique opinions. Which brings us to the arguement of censorship on anything, because what some people find offensive others @MONTH1 not. The censorship that I am discussing  is specifically about censorship in libraries. There are three main reasons why libraries should not be censored. The first reason is the books were written so they could be viewed by the public. The next reason is people have the right to make their own decisions. The final reason is parents can limit what their own children read. The censorship of libraries is an absurd idea, because a few people shouldn't make the choice for everyone.     The first reason that libraries shouldn't be censored is the books were written so they would be read by the public. A library is a public place where people are supposed to get whatever books they choose. If a few people start censoring books then it will set off a chain reaction. After so many different books are censored there will be less books for peole to enjoy. All of the books that were censored were meant to be enjoyed. If books are censored some people @MONTH1 never even get a chance to see those books and they wont be able to learn from them. Books deserve the chance to be enjoyed like they were meant to be enjoyed and if they are censored that chance is gone.     The next reason is people have the right to make their own decisions. If someone doesn't like a book then they don't have to read it. They don't have the right to go censor that book, because they don't like it. Another person @MONTH1 enjoy that book and many others @MONTH1 like it as well. People should be able to choose what books they want and they shouldn't be told by others what they can and can't read. They need to let others make the decision when it comes to getting their books. People can't go around preventing other people from reading a book that they enjoyed. They need to let others think for themselves and let them read what they want to.     The last reason is parents can limit what their children read.If the parents don't want their children reading something then they can tell their children that they aren't allowed to read it. Other people shouldn't be able to censor a book, because it is innapropiate for children. The child's parents can protect them if they find the book offensive for their children. Everyone needs to worry about what they like and let the other people enjoy what they want to. Let the parents set the limit for their children and it makes life simpler. Also it allows everyone else to enjoy the books if they aren't censored just for children. Parents will worry about their children and adults can worry about themselves.     The censorship of libraries is absolutely wrong and it is also unjust. Somone shouldn't be able to say, 'I don't like this book so censor it.' I will remind you of the three reason why this is true. First the books were written so they would be enjoyed by the public.  Also people people have the right to choose what they want. Finally parents can set limits on what their own children read. Books should be left uncensored so they can be enjoyed by whoever wants to read them. Everyone needs to let books be enjoyed by all and they shouldn't take away a books cahnce to be loved by censoring it.	4
3621	Should books and such be removed off of the shelves if they are found offensive? Personally I don't think they should be. If @CAPS3 is something in the book that is remotelly offensive towards children then it should be put under a section for adults only.  Most libraries I have been to have different areas for each age group. If @CAPS3 is a book that is racially unexceptable then it should be put in the adult section not anywhere for children.      When a book is being questioned if it is offensive or not they should review all the possibilities of how someone @MONTH1 comprehend the story to see their reaction with it. @CAPS3 are many genres of books, music, magazines, etc., so @CAPS3 is always a place that the book can go to. Most of the questioning about a book is the language in it. For example, in @CAPS1 we just finished reading the book '@CAPS2 of @ORGANIZATION1.' @CAPS3 is a lot of question if the book should be read in schools or not because of the 'n-word'. It is a very harsh word, but it goes with the setting and the background of the story. When someone is not sure if a book is acceptable or not they should take in concideration what the story is about and whether or not the word is needed or not. In many cases the unexceptable thing @MONTH1 work along with the story.     If one book is being questioned about something wrong with it then shouldn't all books, music, movies, magazines, etc., be questioned? If something is not allowed for one item then it shouldn't be allowed for something else. It is all about the audience who reads that certain book if it is appropriate or not to the person reading it. I have read many books that have certain words that don't bother me, but someone else who isn't use to it @MONTH1 not like. Some parents don't want their kids hearing foul language or inappropriate stuff from the type of music they listen to. It all comes down to who reads the book or magazine, and who listens to the music. Katherine Paterson makes a very good point about how if we start taking the books off of the shelves then eventually @CAPS3 wouldn't be any books left on the shelves anymore. Just becasue something has a bad word or phrase in it doesn't mean it needs to be taken away from peoples enjoyment!	4
4720	I believe that profanity has a good side and a bad side. The good side is profanity is it give books, music, and movies taste and texteure it shows how a person feels most times it's anger. Profanity also can change a person behavior, by the way people talk and act. I personally think that profanity is a good and bad i like it in music and movies but i hate it when people talk trash. I think they should take it off the shelves depending on the person age for example age three and thirteen books should not contain profanity but ages fourteen and up can.           The reason why people should take it off the shelves is beacuse kids should have a healthy and profanity free life. They should have a a good development turds learning. Books and other intertaiment should have no profanity because kids at a young age learn easly and if they take in the bad actions of others they will be bad themselfs. The reason why people should be aware of this problem is if you don't like profanity dont buy it. Also keep out of kids reach. The main reason why people swears is because of movies and songs it changes a person dramaticly. Talking with profanity in your mouth can change your life but not having a good job getting in jail raising up bad kids that learn from the parents mistakes.      In a @CAPS1 profanity is good for movies it gives it action and drama. profanity is words that are most times negative expressing anger and rudeness. We have a @CAPS2 full of profanity this is like a wide spred deases. Passing on from people to kids to their kids. I have expeariance this the hard way beacuse im chinese and i came to the united states back in @DATE1, i did not know any english. People would cuss at me all the time the could all be avoided if we didnt have any profanity in our daily usage of books, music, and movies. I have learned alot about people by the way they talk letting me know who to stay away from. We should keep profanity but limit it from kids. Profanity is like ice cream people wants it and other dont. People could make there choice of putting themselfs in a profanity free life. people can do what they think is the right thing to do. Taking it off the shelves for kids is what i think is the right thing to do but not adults.     Due to profanity people tend to put themselfs in truble. For example some people in the use gets pulled over by a officer for a low cost speeding ticket but then they would swear at the officer putting them selfs in more truble this could all be avoided if he didnt have ever said anything. Profanity could also make a good motivational speech i know this beacuse im on the @LOCATION1 football team. Before every game our coach would motivate us by giving us a speech to get us pumped up with profanity in it. So in the end what im saying is porfanity should say but keep it out of reach of kids for books parents dont buy them if you dont want your kids to see them. Movies read the lable on the back of the @CAPS3 and see the agae limit and for profanity. Lock up the @ORGANIZATION1 shows that have profanity in it so your kids have no acess to them. If you dont want any part of profanity you can make yourself to stayway from it. We all know the there is nothing you can do about others useing profanity just dont use it yourself and stay clean do what you think is right	4
4512	Today, millions of teens are bombarded with all kinds of media garbage. This can range from exposure to certain movies, music, magazines, books, or to even commercials. Parents, teachers, and even governments censor materials such as these to protect the students or the general population on topics that can be offensive or difficult to explain. However is that really the right choice?      In life, we cannot shut our eyes and pretend that there are not harsh concepts out there in the world that we have to face. In fact, our parents and teachers should prepare us to be fully equiped when we go off on our own to find our place in the world. This then begs the question is it okay to censor certain books from the shelves of a library which can potentially enlighten us as growing students? When one conceals information, that person is stealing the right of knowledge. Not only that, but what one person finds offensive another can @MONTH1 not. This topic is just too abstract to be regulated. For example, take what Katherine Paterson said about how if everyone decided to work in this manner, all the books in the world wouldn't be available to any of us.      Therefore censorship in libraries should be condemned because we are only hurting ourselves in the long run when we limit the knowledge we decide to take in	4
3675	Your watching a movie on tv that you and your friend have seen in theatres. You both love the movie and just as it gets close to the best part, the tv skips over that part because people think that that sceen is inapropiate. Censorship is good, but sometimes it is too strick when it comes to movies, music, and books.     Some of the movies that are popular will end up on tv for the viewers entertainment, @CAPS1 some movies have sceens that are a little inapropriate, and even though it's not that offensive, the tv compaies will cut that sceen out of it. Also, if there is bad language in the movie, they will take that word out and replace it with another word that makes no sense with what the movie is trying to say. Censorship tends to ruin the movies that most people love. The tv companies even censor historical movies. If its a historical movie, it shouldn't be censored because it takes away from the true story.     Music is another item that tends to get censored quite often. With music, if there is a bad word, the word is just skipped over or bleeped out which makes the song sound strange. Most songs are censored because parents don't want their children to listen to it. I don't think music should be censored just for little kids. If the parents don't want their children to hear those words, they shouldn't let their children listen to that kind of music.     Book tend to be censored and even banned at schools. Not too many childrens read books anymore so if they do decide to read a book, we should let them read what they want besause reading helps the mind. Some schools banned books becuse of inapropiate language. That is unfair because some books are beautifully written, but children can't read them because of language. Also, some books are censored because they are too detailed when it comes to certain scenes dealing with sex and crime. Some books are just too good to be banned.     A lot of theings seem to be censored in this world. We should have censorship, but it shouldn't be so stricked when it comes to movies, music, and books.	3
3669	I do not think books should be censored from the shelves of library's. Katherine is correct in many ways. We would not have any books if everyone removed the ones the disliked. The world would lose alot of information on important things in their worlds. I'm writing this to explain why I don't think books should be censored.     I don't think book's should be removed if they are offensive to some people because they, sometimes, help people see the errors in their ways like a book about gloryfiying the way white men and women treated @CAPS1 @CAPS2 men and women. now a days people would read that book and if they were racist they wouldn't be after that book,because they see how wrong @CAPS7 is. Music is freedom of speech, some artist's see themselves as 'liberaters', 'idol's',and even 'love spreading',yes their are some songs that could be 'seem' offensive but you'll never know how high a @CAPS3 will grow if u cut @CAPS7 down In example the song titled '@CAPS4' by @CAPS5 @CAPS6,@CAPS7 has catholic churches furious because they automaticly assume she's disrespecting @CAPS8 when in reality she's speaking a whole different tone.     People learn special, powerful  life leasons from things or situations that are shunned by our society and @CAPS7 will probably always remane that way,we don't know.But one thing we do know is we can change what we do in the present and better what were going to do in the future.	4
3005	I think if people find books offensive they should not even read that book to begin with. If books are found offensive and taken from shelves then book shelves would be emtpy. Then their would nothing left for people to read.     Some of the greatest authors use offensive words in their books take them off th shelves and you will be getting rid of the greatest material. @PERSON1 @CAPS1 for example in the book '@CAPS2' its offensive to gays and one gets killed.	2
3841	Books movies and music should not be removed from the shelves. For many of years people would come to the libaray for them. some  @MONTH1 be volger as well as they @MONTH1 be offensive, but there should be a age check out law. as well as being with in consideration for this centerys ways.     There are many people who thribe off of the horrable thing people put out in to the world. They love to pain of others. Instead of taking the offensive work off the shelves, there should be a age limmit to what sertan age groupes should read. Yees there are young kids who are reading this kind of things, but that lyes with the parents.           If there was a age limmit of what people should be able to read then that would solve the problem.As well we could have the parents sign out the book saying it is okay for their child to read such a book.      if we  had all of this then there would not be any more problems. it would be a nice controled libaray. so in conclustion this is the way to go. this is the futur of tommorw	3
3521	If materials are offensive they should not be displayed. Offensive materials can have big effects on children younger than at least ten years of age. I believe that if materials at a library are found offensive and proved to be offensive, then they should be removed.     Materials at libraries are not for everyone. A lot of it is especially not for young children. For example: @CAPS1 could be a young child wanting to check-out a movie that looks interesting  to him/her. The movie could be rated @NUM1 but the parents still check it out for them. Once they watch the movie, it @MONTH1 have some heavy language, sex-related humor or content. Then the child is learning and seeing all of this hapening in a motion picture. Also if they have nervous parents, the library could get some calls. Today, a lot of younger children about @NUM2+ have seen, watched, or read something that had profanity in it or inapropriate conduct in it.     People have read some of the material that the library has and spotted some profanity not knowing it was in @CAPS1. If a religious man/woman checked out a book or a magazine from the library and spotted the profanity they put in a lot of these books and magazines, it would absolutely bother them. If they won't take them off of the shelves, the least they can do is keep a list of all of the materials that have heavy profanity, sex, and strong violence in them. They should do that so they can warn the person who is checking out the material.     With all of the nasty things that are seen in books, movies, magazines, etc., people need to be alerted to what they read and watch. Some of the books can get pretty nasty and terrible with all of the things they say. Library materials must be checked. If they are found offensive, and proved offensive, they should be moved.	4
3788	Throughout my life, I have seen many books that seem offensive to me. However, they should not be censored just because they seem offensive. I believe that books that are found offensive should not be censored.     A reason why I think books that are found offensive should not be censored is because what seems offensive to one person, @MONTH1 not be offensive to another. Classifying something as offensive is an opinion. Unless everyone in the whole world thought that a book was offensive, it should be able to remain open to the public.         Another reason why we should not censor books that are found to be offensive is because in our @LOCATION1, we are given the right to express ourselves freely. If we censored books that are found to be offensive, we would be violating this right. This would not be fair to the people who wrote the books and to those who like them.     The next reason why we should not censor books that are found to be offensive is that if we were to censor every book that we found offensive, we would not have any books to read at all. Books that some people like are found offensive by others. For example, suppose a few people loved the @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 series but another person who read it later found it offensive and had it censored. The people who loved the @ORGANIZATION1 series would now find the books the other person likes and censor them. If this continued, we would have no books to read.     Another reason why I believe books should not be censored is because without offensive books, we would never learn from terrible mistakes. Suppose every book relating to both world wars were censored and could not be read. Sooner or later, no one would remember what terrible things happpened and history could possibly repeat itself. Unless having books that seem offensive is worse than having the events we dread happen again, then books that are found offensive should not be censored.     I believe books that are found to be offensive should not be censored because without them, we would be violating the right to freely express ourselves and we would be allowing terrible things that happened in the past to be forgotten. Without books that are considered offensive, we would not have any books to read at all	4
4586	Should we censor the materials in libraries?  Some people believe that some of the books, magazines, and music in libraries are too vulgar and obscene.  This could be a major problem if people are allowed to say what is too obscene to be put in a library.  Katherine Paterson makes a great point by saying that if everyone was allowed to take books, magazines, and music that they find inappropriate off the shelves, there would be nothing left for us.     Books have been around for centuries.  They are passed on, shared, and enjoyed by people all over the world.  Books contain important information, stories, and tales of people's past times.  Therefore, I do not believe that certain books should be banned from libraries.  By taking away books in libraries, you are taking away the author's freedom of speech.  Also, technology is rapidly advancing, and sometime in the future, I think libraries will become extinct.  With all of the new devices we have @DATE1, people can just get their books online.     Magazines are a great tool to advertise and talk about some major topics happening around the world.  Magazines are a great thing to read when you want to catch up on news, sports, or just other miscellanious topics.  With that said, magazines can also be bad for public libraries due to some of the explicit content.  This is a reason on why some people would want to get rid of magazines from libraries, but I don't think they should be banned.  By getting rid of magazines, you take away company's freedom of press, which is a major issue.  Refering to the previous paragraph, technology is growing, and it is very easy to just go and look at news, sports, and other topics on the @CAPS1.  That is why I do not think magazines should be taken out of libraries.     My final discussion is music.  Music has also been around for many centuries and it has done many things.  Music is something everyone can relate to.  No matter who you are, you probably have some favorite band, music artist, or genre of music that you prefer.  By saying this, I do not think music should be taken out of libraries either.  Taking away music is like taking away humans natural culture.  We all enjoy it, but have different versions that we enjoy.  Therefore, I do not think it would be wise to take away music from libraries.     In conclusion, libraries are nothing without all the history, stories, news, and music that is inside of it.  Censoring the libraries would not be a good idea and it would most likely upset many people.  It is true that with technology that libraries @MONTH1 eventually become extinct.  Until that happens, I hope they do not censor their materials.	4
4194	Censorship in libraries is a topic that is argued back and forth in todays society. It is something that we all should think about and voice our opinions about. I believe that items in a library should not be censored based on constitutional @CAPS5, the creation of gray areas, and the depletion of classic literature.     The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 to the @CAPS3 of the @ORGANIZATION1, clearly @LOCATION1 the idea of freedom of the press. Not only does this give publishers the right to print whatever they please, but it also gives people a right to choose for themselves what they can and want to read. Censoring books in a library would be denying this right that is clearly spelled out in the @CAPS4 of @CAPS5. I refuse to support any idea that directly opposes the @CAPS3 and the people of the @LOCATION1 should be appalled that this sort of thing is even in discussion.      When it comes to censoring something based on how offensive something is, one always has to consider the gray areas that will be formed. For instance, what is offensive in one book @MONTH1 not be offensive to someone else who would benefit from reading it. The term 'offensive' is a reletive one, in that the definition varies from person to person. No one thing can be deemed offensive by one hundred percent of the population and therefore no one thing can be removed without opposition. This creates areas of gray where there is no right answer. This would be extremely problamatic for those trying to censor items within  a library. Secondly, the decision on who would get to decide what is and is not offensive would cause as much contreversy as the books themselves. Knowing that every person carries a different opinion the people deciding would have to equally represent every persons' opinion when making a decision, talk about problamatic.      Finally, censoring books would eliminate classic literature and would deplete an understanding of the world through the eyes of great writers. For example, in @PERSON1's '@CAPS7 @PERSON2' the 'n' word appears over one hundred times. Many @CAPS8 @CAPS9 take great offense at the use of this word. However, this book is seen as one of the centuries greatest works and cannot be removed from the education of young people because of an offensive term. If people want to censor books, then censor them from their own children and not the children of others and inevitably an entire population.     In conclusion, the censorship of literature and other items in a library is not only impossible, but utterly unconstituional. The idea of censoring items from children based on offense is not something that should be pursued	4
4455	Libraries, they are everywhere and all together they contain millions of books that influence everyone who reads them. Whether a book is being read about @PERSON1 or the @CAPS1 there is always something influential to be read. Some books have more adult themes or references to certain subjects which most adults find inappropriate for readers of certain ages. The question is, is it a good idea for those books that are now being censored to be taken off the shelves? In personal opinion; yes those types of books are influential, yes it is possible that it could negatively effect the youth of @DATE1, but everyone has the right to read what interests them.     Being influential is one of the main priorities of most reading materials. There is a point to be proven or a side story to be shared within most books. Is this a bad thing? Is it 'bad' to explain a point of view or to explain a life experience? No, having experiences is only half the point of living; sharing it is the rest. The @ORGANIZATION1 explains one of the more major downfalls in @LOCATION1 and how it brutally effected the people struggling for life and money. Twilight shows the softer side of love and that anyone can be happy if they set their hearts on someone. These are not only experiences but things to ponder upon, and losing these factors in life would be a horrible mistake.     The youth of @DATE1 is portrayed in mostly a negative light. Whether they are considered monsters or maybe even the devils offspring; our youth need influences. Reading is one of the major sources of inspiration for students to grow and prosper. Most students find reading to be boring. In school you are not offered what you want to read. Lists are made, and guidelines are created so that only certain things are read and taught. Young adults need creativity and books are there to shine a light on their eager minds. Taking away the books students and young adults are interested in is one of the many growing problems contributing to people not wanting to read.     Teachers, principals, business men, and even children deserve the right to reading what they like. If you were a sports major and suddenly the population decided sports journals and sports themselves were too harmful and badly influential to people; what would you do when suddenly everything sports related was taken away? You would lose your career. Romance novelists use sensual or even sexual experiences to convey something everyone has trembling inside their minds. Taking away something that is related to something so natural in every day life would have severe reprocussions; especially for those who greatly enjoy those books. Revoking the rights to the literary works of thousands of authors would also take away an intellectual culture that is conveyed.     Influencing people to think about things that are viewed by everyone is not a bad thing when it can be used to inspire people in their lives. Just because someone is a student or a child doesn't mean that a literary work could rot their mind. Taking away something that can contribute to the every day art of life would slowly create a less creative, inventive, and inspired world. Not everyone believes that certain books are bad, and i, am one of those  thousands of people.	4
4281	Corrupt Censorship     @CAPS1 @MONTH1 occur when censorship decides to remove or block; showing certain media or readable content all pertains to the creator. In some cases, the distributor and less the author, director, or publisher, has no opinion on whether to display the product they have made, but from their own habit of making what they enjoy; it is the will from the store, person or etc. to display these materials. Libraries have an exponential option to publicly put up on their shelves or stock, but restricting too graphic material is all depended on the eduacational rules the library is equipted with.          Any type of content is art, art that should never be even considered to be changed or enhanced because it pertains to one artist. You can never remake, rewrite or recreate that visual material provided from the creator. And you are not aloud to, unless given permission to from the creator. Censoring or removing on the other hand, is permitted to the distributor. Their choice to publicly demonstrate something made by someone is all their choice.     Libraries for example, show that any given media or readable content is publicly displayed for anyone to see, so long as the audience fits their rules or criterias. In some instances, partial side of the audience will run across unexpected media and will have the inexecptional pursuasion to accept what is demonstrated. Though it is not the creators fault to ensure where their content is diplayed, but the audience's fault in whether to see that material. It is choice to read or see whatever you'd like, you aren't forced upon to follow through to what the distributor-let alone the creator- is offering. Enjoying the topic or material is optional.   When you have options in front of you, any given topics or subject to read or follow, it it your will to chose to read or see them. Enjoying is even more harder, but when a library's limit is basically the sky, you should not force it on them to throw out the book just because the censorship isnt up to your level. It is not the library to blame, but your own. Everyone has different views on certain content and it isnt your obligation to view it.      When you take down materials @CAPS2 intended for those who chose to view and enjoy, you destroy not @CAPS2 art a creator has made, but the joy that filled a viewers taste. Libraries shouldnt exceptionalize for certain people's expectations because not everyone finds censorship a solution. Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if i have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work i abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so deos everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'	4
4030	I believe that certain materials that seem offensive to certain people should stay on the shelves. I feel like as though its on that person whether they choose to read or listen to the material or not. I have also been in this position where I came cross an article that upset me. Also I have had an arguement once with someone who found what I was listening to was offensive to them.    Once when I was reading a paper on that was making fun of my town that I grew up in. The paper said how my town was filled with rednecks and that many people there were not very educated and not intelligent. This upest me and made me feel ashamed for living there. But I thought more and more that this article was someone elses opinion. That just because they wrote that article, doesn't make it true.    This arguement went out of hand. She had her opinion and I also had mine. My friend came by my house one day to hang out and do some homework. While we were in my room I turned on my favorite artists cd. I listened to rock music at the time and loved how talented the artist was. My friend went to my sterio and turned it off. She told me she didnt like it and that it was offensive music. So after that we pretty much argued the whole time. I finally said that I feel its great music and I shouldnt have to stop listening to it. We had a deal that while she was there I wouldnt listen to it, I felt I would respect her feelings.    Over the past years I have observed that more people are taking what others have to say or sing about to heart. When an author writes a story or an article, they are putting their opinion into it. Sometimes they are typing the facts and also what they feel is write to say. I mean if it is on the shelf and dislike it, dont pick it up and read it.	3
3886	When ever has a few bad things being said ever effected how or what people read @CAPS2 a days. That's what is hot in this present lifetime. No one wants to read a boring article, not unless it's meant to be. I'm going to share with you my opinions on certain materials, such as books, music, magazines, ect.,should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. I have observations, experience, and reading some of my the articles that were called offensive to prove my opinions.     In my opinion, no ones work should be taken off of a shelf due to any thing, because I'm sure they worked on it an awful lot for it to be placed on a shelf. So there is no reason for it to be taken off. If that was my stuff that had got took off the shelves I would be shocked and upset. So that is one reason why you shouldn't do that. It could hurt people emotionly.     Following that statement, but there can be times where you just don't want them to be seen because they are to embarrassing. Such as an athlete interviewed in an @CAPS1 article, that got suspended from their sport due to violations, and this athlete is just cursing and being out of control. I would put that article away also, just so the public won't see it and no one is put on blast.     Finally, @CAPS2 everyone knows that some types of movies, and music can't be put on display in public. So you would have to ask for the movie or @CAPS3 and someone will go get it from the back for you, due to explicit content or explicit lyrics. G-@CAPS4 @NUM1, should be the only movies allowed on shelves, rated @CAPS5 and up should be behind counter, and the same with music. I am pretty sure that is clear with this audience.     @CAPS2 that I have shared with you my opinions on different views on censorship in libbraries what is you thoughts on this topic as you read this persuasive essay. You have read my thoughts on experience, observations, and just common sense on this topice. If you had to write an essay on censorship in libraries, how would you come about this.	3
4366	I do agree with this topic at hand, some of the material that is being displayed on the shelves at our local library is inappropite or sometimes valgar. Way too @MONTH1 people get away with way too many things in this day and age. Our society we live in is just a total wreck and complete, utter disaster. Something has to be done to put an end to this madness.     Someone would think that if a librarian put an inappropite book up on the self, that @CAPS1 is inevitable that a child or someone irresponsible would find the book. Yet we still witness children reading or looking at a book, type of media, or entainment that is not suitable for their age group. Sometimes adults find books that are not pleasing, why would we put them on a self to be publicly displayed? That is a question that I have yet to find the solution to.     I got home from school a couple of days ago and I heard this hip-hop music comming from my nine year old sister's room. I started to listen to the lyrics and they were absolutley awful, @CAPS1 was singing about drugs, sex, and alcohol. I went in her room and turned @CAPS1 off and questioned her where she got the @ORGANIZATION1 from. She replied 'the library.'     That's just another example of what I'm speaking about. If someone at the age of nine can check out a @CAPS2.D. like that, then imagine what is avalible to me at the age of sixteen. Adolessence do not need those kinds of thoughts and words in their vocabulary. I'm just afraid for the next generation; what are they going to be listening to? What are they going to be reading?     And @CAPS1's not just the library, @CAPS1's everywhere! We can't even live a day of our lives in this society with out hearing something bad on the radio, on tv, or even in public. Everywhere we turn is something bad or valgar. So we need to think about ourselves and our children and try to clean up our acts a little bit. We need to stand up for what's appropite and what's right	4
4675	No i do not figure that. I say that there is some material for adults, teens and children. The children aren't going to want to read the adult books and the adults aren't going to wanna read the childrerns books the teens aren't going to want to read the childrens books but they @MONTH1 want to read the adult books and thats ok. They will be adults soon they @MONTH1 be interested. there is nothing wrong with that. If the parents do not want there teens or children reading that kindf of material then they should go with them to the libary and make them  get you approvial befor checking out the books, magazines or wwhatever it is they wanna read at the time. Movies are the samje there are different materials for each age group some age groups @MONTH1 be interested in other age groups material and thats ok doesn't maen it's wrong just means thetre maturing more and are interested or couriouse let them explore they will figurt for them serlfs if the material is righrt for them or not	2
3183	What is consitered offensive? If we took books, music, movies and magazines that people found offensive of shelfs there would be nothing left. Everyone is diffrent which mean they all get offended in diffrent ways. By taking all this off shelfs we would be providing a smaller education for students around the world.          Things we learn about in school, slavery, wars and some pollitics. Now all these things could offend many people but if we were to take them of off the shelfs at school and libraries children will have no idea about history or what is going on in the current world. What about drugs and alchol, many parents do not talk to their childern about the uses of controlled substances, so without these sources they @MONTH1 never know the harm that they can do to someones body. Everyone takes something offensive but not everyone takes the same thing offensive. So who is to say what offends people and what does not? If thats the case shouldn't we take all books, movies, music and magazines away from childrens schools and libraries? Adults get offended to so would we take all of their resources away also including the newspaper. By taking away what one @MONTH1 call offensive @MONTH1 land us in the dark ages with no books, no local news, no movies, no nothing because not one person can say what the whole world considers offensive.   Everyone has the right to read and write what they want. No one can say what offends everyone. Someone @MONTH1 get offended by talking about ones race, another @MONTH1 get offended by talking about @CAPS1 and someone @MONTH1 even get offended if you talk about their cute little kitty cat. Everyone looks at everythings diffrently. So why try and control us all as one. All people think diffrent and they know what they want to read, hear and watch all by them selfs, they don't need someone to tell them.	3
3819	The author Katherine Paterson makes a very good point when she states that there are books on the shelf that poeple wish that there kids or even there on self did not read or that people wish they did not read. But if your were to take away ever book someone found offensive there would be hardly any books left in this world. There will always be one person that finds a book that they do not like because of tone the author uses or if they do not like what they call eachother. People all have there own mind sit to away that they want to live or how they want there kids to live.      Having books taken off the shelf because people do not like them would result in having no more books on our shelves. I feel like if there books on the shelves about kids drinking then have bad effects on there life cause they did drink then maybe the kid reading it would stop drinking or not even try drinking. The books about getting raped and them not telling becasue they are afriad of what would happening. Then in the long run telling after they get pregant or injured from it. Them saying that they wish they would have told might help the kids that this happened to or this might happen to might help them feel so relief and tell someone and save themself. Books like these should not get taken off the shelf because one person does not like it, in the long run if they did take it off some could get hurt or not know what to do and it couls be all that one person that did not like it fault. How would you feel if you did that to someone. Maryrin @CAPS1 is a good Author that shows how something that you @MONTH1 think is good but truns out to be really bad. Her books focus a lot on how girls need to watch what they are doing to keep themselves safe.     I have a friend that have parents that do not like the music on her ipod. So she had to take it off. Well with taking it off she made @CAPS2 of the songs that they did not like. She drives so they music is always playing on the radio while she drives so she can listen to the songs that she does not have on her ipod. That is just one example of how you will always get around listening to what you want to hear. Music will always be out there. There will always be songs that poeple do not like. Either due to there religion or even if they do not like the words used. But even if they stop putting songs on the radio there is still internet out there and people can just get there songs from there.     There are songs out there that should not be out there but the more someone tries to push the songs out of the world and out of people listening to them the more some kids or even adults are going to try to listen to them. In the world today there are always a good and a bad song that is the same. Artics now always have a bad song that they would have to make into a good song. That is just how the songs go. That is just how they use there brains. No one can stop them. Not even the people that publish the songs and put then on the radio.      In the long run of things the more people try to stop things from not being in this world the more people are going to try to get them. It is a very bad idea to take the books off of shelves and take music off of the radio. People need to hear what bad things can happen when you do not listen to someone. A kid @MONTH1 grow up knowing not to talk to people they do not know but never really understand what bad could come out of it. But when they read a book about a kid there age getting kidnapped they @MONTH1 understand more clearly on the whys in life.      So if I can say so myself I think that it is a very bad idea for books to be taken off the shelf because one mother or two dads think that book is not good for thier little girl or there teenage son. They need to read it for themself and find out what really could happen if they did something like that. Keep the books on the self. Keep playing the some music. Let your kids or grandchildren find out the danger on there own rather then you just keep telling them. I am a teenage girl and I would rather read about it then having my parents tell me over and over agian. So keep the books on the shelves. That the radio play. Just be safe in doing it.	4
4424	I think they should be taken off the shelves if they are to vaulger to young children. like if it has to deal with sex or violence they should be taken off shelves. they should only be aloud to put @NUM1 stuff on the shelves. i think that they shouldnt even makes books or magazines like that unless they can keep them hid from people under the age of @NUM2. but people are gonna do what they want to do. thats all i have to say. have a nice day.	2
2980	Do you think that libraries should remove certain materials off the shelves? People have different oppions, of whats good and whats bad. I have read and seen a lot of books in my life time. I hear people telling me, 'oh dont read that book its a bad book.'But I ask myself, @CAPS2 do I know it's a bad book when I haven't even given it a chance?'      @CAPS1 are some books, music, movies, and magazines out @CAPS1 that are offensive. Yet we still want to read, listen, watch, and look at them. If we tried to remove all the offensive books, from the libraries we wouldn't have anything left on the shelves. Katherine Paterson said, 'If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf that work i abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Katherine Paterson makes a great point out of her quote. Why should we have to remove a book if just some people think its offensive?     Ask yourself the question again, '@CAPS2 do you know it's a bad book when you haven't even given it a chance?' @CAPS3't judge a book by what you hear. Find out what your own oppion is	2
4402	Yes there are many things today that have censorship,but should keep them out of our libraries.I think not.They should not be taken items out of the libraries do to censorships.Maybe if they are such a big concern they could do something else with them besides taking them out.     I don't believe that they shouldn't take out censorship items out of the libraries just becase some people have a problem with it.Becase now a days you can go out in public and hear the same stuff they put in those censored movies,games,@CAPS1's,etc.I think that if they are even thinking about taking cencored product out of the library it should be up to the library and not the goverment.     If censorship is such a big problem with people they dont have to check it out or look at it. So maybe if they are having problem's with parents becase there kids are checking he censored items out they should have a band.Like if you want to out a item with a censorship you either have to be @NUM1 or have a parent or guardin with you.But if it is still have a problem with it make it like tabacco products were you have to be @NUM1.     Then if the libraries don't want to do that they could make a whole room just for censored items.They sould also put the room in a corner or in a less populated area of the library.There should also have to have a sign saying there are sencorhip items in that room and, maybe a sign saying @NUM1 and older.     So there are many other was to dealing with censored items.Sence there are so many was to deal with them why take them out.We should not have to take censorship item out just becase some people do not like it.why punish every one becase of a few people	3
4670	Yes I do believe that certain books, movies, music, etc., should be removed. They should be put in a different position for children unable to find in the area. Because certain materials in the objects listed can start off bad behavior.        In order to keep the objects from being found from childern is to set them in a different area. Some where childern are unable to reach. like in high areas like the top of the shelf, or the closet, maybe the attic. For better safe keepings place the certain objects you feel that can give childern bad ideas in a personal safe. where no one is able to get things out.         It is important for some items to be seen, listened to, or watched for older people.For example, books can provide pictures for childern to do things that arn't right in there cerent age. Music can talk about stuff that that person done, and make that child want to do it because they might think its cool cause the artist does it. For the magazines they show articals of rapper, actors, and other famous people doing somthing wrong. showing a bad example for the child.Now for the materials they should be hidden in a place where no child would think to look at. Because the materials some times harm the child or maybe even put the child in the hospital.    From experience I have thouched or took some material I shouldn't have messed with and the outcome wasn't good. From that experience I've learned not to thouch with items I know not to mess with.     Thats why it is important to keep certain items from childern. Because the outcome maynot be what you wanted. serious actions might come from the objects, and later on come from the same child that either listed to, saw it, or looked at it. So make sure the items are safe from childern hands	3
3169	'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 is such a strong statement by Katherine Paterson in regards to censorship in libraries. So often today do we hear of books, magazines, and numerous other resources in libraries being banned because of unpopular views. A classic novel, The @CAPS2 of @CAPS3 @CAPS4, has been removed from the shelves of many public and school libraries because of crude language such as the word 'nigger'. Libraries should not take resources off their shelves due to offensiveness because it goes against the library's purpose and because many people have different views.     A library is a place with resources provided for information, interest, and enlightnement. When a book or magazine is taken away because of origin, background, or views that seem obscene or unpopular, then that library isn't serving its purpose. If I wanted to find a book on @CAPS5 but the library banned it because another religion found its teachings offensive, then why not ban the other religion's books as well? @CAPS1 goes back to what was said by Katherine Paterson earlier. What might be offensive to one person could be a lifestyle or interest to another.      Children, however, should be treated as a special case. No, a child should probably not, in my opinion, be reading about adult things such as sex. However, that child's parent or guardian is the only one who has the right to restrict resources they feel as inapropriate. In most public libraries, young children are not aloud to roam the library without an adult. @CAPS1 is a very prominant rule because it sets boudaries for the adolescent so they are not to read about or listen to anything they shouldn't. Also, it is keen that libraries divide up the different resources into separate sections for children, young adults, and adults.      Banning books and such from libraries takes away a part of history and leaves a gap for the future. To find that what our parents were once reading is restricted should not be an issue. Materials should not be censored in libraries beacuse they are found offensive becuase @CAPS1 is censorship and it takes away our rights.	3
3714	Yes, I do believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc.,  should be removed from the shelves if thery are found offensive. The reason why I think some things shuld be removed is because some kids don't need to look at certain things. Parents don't always go with there children to the library and tell them what they can and can't get. At school libraries they really dont have bad things they only have school approte things. But the public library has alot of different things and than a school library. Therefore those are my reaons why i believe certain materials should be removed.	2
4115	I am writing this essay to you to tell you. That offensive books,music,movies,magazines,etc., Should not be on our library shelves. Because If are kids pick them up there will be @CAPS1, and crime. Some people mite ask how do I know this well say you see this cd cass that says black mans only cd. And a white boy picks it up well then a black kid sees it and that white boys hand the black guy will try to rip it out of his hand. Therefore starting a fight.	2
3188	I think that they should remove books, and take away more stuff from the kids now a days, because they are getting worse in worse like everyday, i think they should move the @NUM1 to @NUM2, so atleast they are old enough to read, hear, or watch whatever they want, but they should go through and do a self-check on everything that they put out  in the stores.They should also have different parts in a library so that the little ones dont get to the adult section, such as adult books, that have stuff in them about sex, drugs, or anything else that falls under that catagory. I have @NUM3 little brothers, and they are @NUM4, @NUM5, @NUM6. They know more stuff then my parents, and its because now a days kids pick up on stuff a lot more easier. So i say we as in the @LOCATION1 citizens need to watch out on how we put stuff out there that the kids can get a hold of.          When i was growing-up i didnt know as much as my little brothers do today, and that is because everyday they are coming out with something else everyday that can effect our kids, brothers, or whoever. I also do think the schools should have a class about the stuff that kids are experiencing in todays life, in like elementary school, so that when they get older they will already know about the drugs, or the sex life. Kids also remember stuff a lot more when they are growing up, so if we put it in there heads at a really really young age, they will remember it. Im not saying that kids will stop doing what they are doing, but atleast the percent population will go down, and parents will be a lot more happier. I also think that parents should stop lying to there kids about sex, making up stories so that there kid wont know, they need to stop doing that because they are going to find out about it sooner or later, so why not now? they whould be more aware of the real life in how it is out there, so all the parents out there should not lie to there kids about the sex life.                So thats what my person input is on the situation. I wish this would change sooner or later before the world becomes a big mess.	3
4533	I believe that certain materials,such as books,movies,magazines,etc, should not be removed if they are offensive to others because censorship and libraries has their own rights to have what they want on their shilves.Yes you @MONTH1 say that some things are unapropriate for children to see but there is an children side of every libraryso that children would not have to see unapropriate things.I feel as thought that no one has the right to tell another store where to locate their things.       Also i can understand where the author is coming from but you would have to understand there is people oput there in the @LOCATION1 that would like to read or listen to unapropiate things that parent would not allow there children to see or listen to.I would also consider that @CAPS2, @CAPS1 dont let your child or children attend that library or that certain place where you know there is despictable materials there.Everyone has their own personal right to place there things where they want them to be.     There are many other options,@CAPS2 can order their books online or go to the library with their child.When I was a young girl my mom never let mee go anywhere along so i never had to worry about seeing anything unapropriate or affensive.Now a days in @DATE1 children know right from wrong.Children know what they suppose to read and does not.       I do also agree if a librarian or an adult see or hear children looking or listening to something i they know they should not be,They should stop the child or converscate them from the premises.         So No i do not agree with you.I still think that people should have the right to place there things where they want because it is their stuff and their property.	3
4523	Libraries are filled with books, magazines, music, movies, and many more materials. All of the materials cover a really wide range of topics. For example, movies can be a comedy, mystery, or adventure. However, some of this material is not suitable for some viewers and can be very offensive to them. For this reason, these offensive materials should be removed from libraries.     One reason offensive material should be removed from libraries is because it can lead to violence in teenagers. If a teenager is continually reading books or watching movies that have violence in them, then they might think violent behavior is all right. They might not know that violence is not the answer to many problems, and they will not realize that there are other solutions to a problem.      One case that proves seeing offensive material can lead to violence occurred in a high school. A straight-A student got a grade she thought she did not deserve from a teacher. This student then painted her face white, put on red lipstick, and took a knife to the teacher's classroom during school. She then proceded to threaten to kill the teacher. She got the idea from the movie '@CAPS1', and her costume resembled the @CAPS2. Some students in the classroom at the time called @NUM1, and the police officers convinced the girl to put down the knife. Maybe if she had not seen the movie she would not have threatened to kill her teacher.     Another reason offensive material should be removed from libraries is because the material is sometimes inappropriate for younger children. The children might just be looking at books and magazines in the library and not even check it out. This way no one will know that they read it. Some of the books in libraries have subjects like sex and drugs in them. When the child reads this, he might want to do everything that is in the book. I have  read a book that contains sex and drugs. The book might put awful ideas into the child's head if he read it.     After all is said and done, offensive material should be removed from libraries. The material can lead to violent acts in people, even if it does not seem like that kind of behavior could possibly come out of that person. The material can also be inappropriate for younger children. All in all, material in libraries can be offensive to some people.	4
3654	In my opinion I believe all types of material should be allowed in libraries. If someone takes offense to a particular topic or section they dont have to read it. Not just certain types of genre and themes or magazines. Everyones different meaning they have differents personalities and views on what they like. I think libraries such actually expand thier variety of books.          Libraries that don't cater to a persons desires or interests , what would make them want to stay?  Libraries should be filled with all sorts of subjects appealing to everyone. Just like how they have an adult and children section. Everyone has a place were that feel like they belong. Even if some people get offended. A person can get offended anywhere not just by a certain magazine or some music style.      I do believe if there is a certain line of respect of course. Nothing should get to out of line were it's an issue with a numerous amount of consumers complaining about the same topic. You can tell if a certain section or material is crossing the line. Each section should be written to speak the truth but also in a respectful manner.      In the times that I've been to the library there @MONTH1 be some things that I don't agree with how certain things are certain ways. But then I see a person really enjoying their time at the library. I know when I go I always find  my style of music that appeals to me. Not just the same thing everywhere I go. Theres always a choices, different options and more things I can learn about.     Keeping all the materials like books, music, movies, etc is a way to appeal for everyone. I person should have their opinion and the choice to be able to read what they like. There will always be a certain movie or book you don't care for ,but others might. If everyone told what they like and don't like about a  certain book. Where's the variety? What books will be left? Everyone has their on thoughts on what they like, if theres a topic you don't like you probably know least about it. And the library is a good way to search and find information about anything	4
4635	Censorship in libraries is good in some ways.  People who like to read books should have a wide variety of books.      Things that offend people: for instance, a book about @CAPS1 @CAPS2 or natives and how they were treated so poorly. But almost anything now days offends peoaple and its rediculous. either way there is always going to be something that someone finds offensive.     My expirience with this situation it really didn't bother me. But I was in a library glancing through a book and I read a paragragh and it had the word, 'nigger,' in it and I found it a little offinsive. That word just really isn't nice.      People like different books movies magazines ect., and some of the greatest movies of all time, well im pretty sure some people find them offinsive in some way. What some might find offinsive, others might think different. Like in magazines my aunt finds them offinsive because of the bathing suit modles in it for addvertising a new swim suit. or for addvertising liquir.     All together, just about everything is offinsive to somone out there. If all the things that people found offinsive was to be removed, then there would hardly be any books movies ect., and not only that it would suck all together	3
4239	They should be aloud to be removed because some books are offensive. Even if they are offensive they can teach young teenagers about their past. The books could be about the kkk or the @ORGANIZATION1. Some young teens like to read books like this so they can learn and see what people went threw. The books could be a school assignment.           The way i see it is if your teenage child is interested in the history or the violence of the past you should allow them to read what they want. Some book such as @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 and @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS6 are great to read for school assignments. These @CAPS6 book's are very helpful to read because you can learn about your history and about the wars at the same time. I think if your child checks a book out from the library he or she should return it in a week.     The library should give the child a certain amount of time to return the book. If the child dose not return the book in that amount of time they should charge them for every day it is late. If the book is damaged they shud charge who ever checked that book out. The book shud be in the condition it was in when it left so other people can check it out after its returned. the library should keep certain books at the library such as the bible and collage books.      The libary should allow @CAPS6 books to each person. Instead of three or four this would keep books on the shelfs. It would also keep people from loosing books. I think people under twenty @CAPS3 should not be aloud to check out movies or music. I think they should have to show i.d. to prove there over twenty @CAPS3. there should be more rules then just being quit in the library they should make people start keeping books at the library and only allow them to take home @CAPS3 or @CAPS6 books. For instance i check out @CAPS3 book every week and return the @CAPS3 i checked out the same day i go to get a new @CAPS3. I only check out the book i really want to read and i read it and return it. The magazines should never be checked out.	3
3702	From what I seen in my life about censorship is that they should not take stuff off of the shelf just because of its content.  I think that libraries should keep the thing in the shelves but seperated from the rest if found offensive.  It's bad enough that everybody is offended by the smallest thing which makes it difficult for everybody else to enjoy it.  I think that we should not even censor the content because I feel like that is making people wanting to know why they censored it in the first place.          My personal opinion is that censorship is useless because it ruins it for everybody because one person got offended.  I like the saying sticks and stones @MONTH1 break my bones but words will never hurt because it says if your offended then get over it.  Why should your opinion speak for everyone else.  Another reason why I believe that we shouldn't censor things is if someone really wants to know they could always find a way to get it so the censorship thing is kind of pointless.  I also feel like censorship is making people soft because everything is censored and when people get into the real world they get hit hard.          My conclusion is that they should seperate the stuff that is offensive and put it in another section of the library.  They could also develop a rating system like they do in video games so you know what kind of content is in it.  Simple stuff like this can make everyone happy because the person who is offended doesn't have look at the stuff that he hates.	3
3497	'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' @CAPS1 does that mean well I guess it means if their is a book on the shelf then they probly dont want their children to get a hold of it. Maybe there parents should look at the books first or maybe they should have taken it off the shelf. I think all books that have offensive stuff in them should be taken off the shelf.If I was going to take books off the shelf it would only be the offensive science fiction books. If @CAPS3 based on a true story and @CAPS3 offensive it should be heard anywise because @CAPS3 part of history. Everyone needs to hear it because @CAPS3 true. If I was going to take music off the shelf it would only be the ones with a lot of bad language. For movies children should only whach @CAPS2 rated movies and nothing else. For magazines children should not read magazines they should be taken off the shelfs.The experiences I had with all these things when I was a child was my parents never let me whach anything or listen with anything with bad language. But I could read any book I wanted to. It was in a book @CAPS3 not like I could onder stand @CAPS1 that bad ward ment.I think @PERSON1 saying is that she wants to keep all books on the shelf because she said 'you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'  I think the point can go ether way because she says everyone has the same rights. And then she states that their wont be any books left for us. I think that means every book is bad if shes saying @CAPS1 i think shes saying.Their is a way to leave the books, music, movies, magazines, etc.,  on the shelfs. Like I sayed in the first pargraph there parents need to pay more attention to their children. And no @CAPS1 their reading. To sum it all up I say take them off the shelfs.	3
4717	I think that no books should be taken away. I think that if a aduld or a child wants to look at something or read about something they should have the right to. If someone were to go to a public library that allowed people to listen to music and they cant because the song has curse words in it they should be allowed to. And if it bothers someone the bothered person can leave.          If someone wants to look at a magazine and they can't because it is inapropiate who cares. And if people wanted to check out a movie at a library and they cant because it's to violent so the library doesn't have it. I think librarys should be able to have whatever inventory they want. And if it's to violent or if the music is to dirty just don't let children get a hold of it.	2
3482	All libraries have books for all readers no matter the age.  The books on the shelf are arranged or should be arranged in alphabetical order with the last name of the author first.  I think that some, but not all, reading materials such as books, music, mvies, should be removed due to some of the graphics in each reading material.     Every bookshelf should be arranged by age difference and spread apart from the other books and or bookshelfs.  If a child would be in the appropriate isle for there age styled books, less children would pick up the wrong book.  If children would understand to listen and follow dircections on where to find there specific age appropriate books, less accidents of children taking the wrong book from the bookshelf would occur.     If children would take the wrong age appropriate book off the bookshelf, I would think that their parent(s) would be responsible and take it back and get the right book for their child(s).  If parents would be responsible for taking action, their child should understand that they are taking the wrong book from the bookshelf.  Wouldn't children understand that if their parent has to take the wrong book back, that they would learn not to do it again?     I think that some, but not all, reading materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed due to some of the graphical features in each reading material.  The books on each bookshelf are or should be arranged in alphabetical order with the last name of the author first.  All libraries have books for all readers no matter the age.	3
3346	Should books, magazines, or movies that are found offensive be removed from the shelves? I think that the book, magazine, or movie should stay on the shelf even if it is found offensive. If it is offensive to one person, it doesn't mean that it is to every person. Everyone has their own view on the subject of offensive or not.     I don't think the person that wrote the book or magazine meant for it to be offensive. They were just writing what they thought went along with the story and some people took offense from the book or magazine. But, they shouldn't argue over it because, like I said before, the author probably didn't mean for it to be offensive.     In conclusion, the books should stay on the shelves. Everyone has different point of view. The author probably didnt mean for the book or magazine to be offensive.	2
3107	Two of the many privaleges that we have as @CAPS1 are freedom of speech and freedom of expression. Although some bodies of work @MONTH1 be percieved as offensive or inappropriate, I believe that they should still be available to the public. Some might agree with the topic being expressed, even if it is offensive or inappropriate, and others @MONTH1 not; but they should not be removed from libraries because of their negativity.     These offensive or harsh pieces of literature could even be used to show the public what is considered rude, offensive, or inappropriate, and should be thought of as learning tools instead of being banned. Every person has a right to an opinion, and others @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not agree with what that person has to say, but it does not change the fact that they have the right to their beliefs.     Katherine Paterson says, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the self'. I myself have read literature that is considered offensive, but as disturbing as the literature was, I am glad that I was educated on what people thought was acceptable behavior so that I know, and can teach others that despite what the book said, we now know that it was describing how people should not be living.     I believe that it would be a grave mistake to remove these materials from the public eye, because many are ingorant to the historical beliefs of others that have affected our nation and other countries across the globe. All of these books are educational, though some are harsh, and they should be used to show what is right and wrong. If they are taken off of shelves in the libraries then people, especially children could start to think that a certain idea, that @MONTH1 be incorrect or offensive, is completely appropriate and acceptable. As someone once said, '@CAPS2 who do not know their history are bound to repeat it'.     By removing the problem, we would be creating another issue. For example, many books have been written over history that convey hatred and discrimination towards other cultures, ethnicities, religions, and lifestyles. If @CAPS2 works of literature were banned and not available to the public, many people would not know that it is wrong to show hatred towards others just because they are different than you. This type of literature provides usefull information: it allows people to see how a large amount of people thought life should have been years ago, and they taught the people of @DATE1 that it actually was how people should not be living.	3
3862	Libraries are a place for everyone; from young children, to the eldery, therefore there is material to suite all ages. When you go to a library you assume that no matter what kind of book you are wanting to read, they will have it. From personal prefrences, to school research projects, libraries should have it all right? Well some libraries want to take that concept away.      A library has books on nearly all subjects. That is because of the individual differences of the people that go to the library. Someone of an extremist religion group could be going there to read on something of their religion. If a strict @CAPS1 would happen to find a book on the extreme religion they could be offended. That situation could go both ways though. Because of the individuality of people and different beliefs and customs we are all going to appreciate and depreciate all different kinds of literature.      Most of the libraries are big enough to be sorted into sections. There are sections for young adults, mature adults, children, non fiction, fiction, science fiction, and so on. If a child ventures off to the mature adult section and flips through the pages of a book that is above their maturity level, then that is the childs fault. The mature people who can handle the content of more adult-orientated books shouldn't be punished by the library removing all books of that content because a child didn't stay in their designated area.          With different cultural beliefs comes different beliefs and views of everyday things. Some readers could strongly disagree with a book and others could recommend it to all of their friends and family. One book to one person could mean something totally different to another. It could be understandable if there were books about sex, for example, right next to the childrens' books, but that isn't the case in most libraries. Libraries could even have a restricted section that warns readers about the content of material in the books in that specific area.      Books in libraries are wrote for multiple kinds of people. Age, gender, religion, maturity, race, political beliefs, and so on will all effect the way you take to a book. Whether or not a book appeals to you is about your beliefs, values, or customs. With that being said, why would a library take away books that only a certain percentage of people will disagree with? Taking away books of a certain subject could upset people that like that type of book or it could even pertain to their everyday lives.      A library is a place of knowlegde. It is filled with facts, beliefs, theories, and opinions of people. Wouldn't removing someones opportunity to read into a subject be revoking the author and their freedom of speech? Just because of a controversial subject or mature topic shouldn't mean that people shouldn't be allowed to read it. If people could only read certain literature that someone else is deciding whether or not it is okay to read, then where is their freedom?       A library is a place for everyone. It has all different kinds of books for all different kinds of people. A libraries interior could be arranged to that the young children aren't going to find a book about sex near their kid books. Taking away certain books pertaining to controversial subjects isn't fair to those who don't disagree with that topic. A library should be a place of balance. A place where someone could read on anything they want to, not what certain people think they should or shouldn't read	5
4176	Good? Bad? Offensive or not? These are just a few of the questions asked when referring to content in any given book, magazine, or even a song. Who are we to judge what's good, what's offensive, or even what is appropriate for any being?     From things such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc. the author(s) @MONTH1 express what they feel on a given topic. Though their opinion might not please others, there's nothing that can be done about it. In society people are going to talk, to write, to sing, to listen. Whether everyone agrees with that is a different story.      In society, no matter what the topic is, there will always be at least one person that has a problem with it. The world will never be perfect! The only thing that can be done to assuage the chaos is for people to self censor what they @MONTH1 ingest from reading or listening to these different books and lyrics. If one shows so much emnity towards a given topic, then they are able to do as they please, and choose not to listen/read.      At the bottom of numerous cd's, both explicit and non, there is a label, an advisory that warns a person. It will briefly tell you that there is some content they @MONTH1 not be appropriate, that @MONTH1 hurt feelings, and simply offend. It is then that one can choose to listen to the cd or not.      Every human is entitled to freedom of speech. This doesn't necessarily mean that everything said by a being is okay; but everyone is entitled to his own opinion. There are words spoken that will offend many! From @PERSON1 using racial slurs in speeches, to @LOCATION1 calling females derrogatory words, all the way back to a white male calling his colored friend a nigger.      People will always be offended. There are many different ways of looking at life, and many different opinions. Not everyone agrees with one another, because everyone is unique in his own way. From ethnicity to personalites, from talented athletes to intelligent students, and even from ancestors to religion. Everyone has something that defines them and makes them who they are. We are all special; and we all think differently. We find certain slurs and lyrics offensive, while others @MONTH1 not.      @NUM1 years ago when i was in @NUM2 grade, my @CAPS1 class was reading a story about the '@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4'. There were @CAPS4 young black children striving to get a respected education in a white school. Times were tough then, and there was still alot of racism in @LOCATION2. As my teacher read us this book everyday, we all sat and listened taciturnly. After the third day of reading this book, we all sat down like usual ready to finish the book. Five minutes into class as the teacher was reading the book, she read and enunciated every word in the book. In the middle of the sentence, it read 'nigger-lover', and the teacher didn't hesitate a bit as she said it. In less than @MONEY1, @NUM3 blacks children walked out of the room yelling curse words at the top of their lungs. This teacher didn't realize that she had offended these children by what she took as simply reading to her class.      The book '@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4' wasn't censored in any way. Though many children looked at it and felt some of the terms were harsh, no one ever thought there would ever be a riot caused at school. Because the teacher was white, and the children didn't want her to say that word, everyone attacked her vocally.      I've began to realize that everyone cannot be pleased. There will always be at least @NUM4 person that stands up and retaliates against something they dislike. In '@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4', the book wasn't censored, but I still believe that it should stay on library shelves. That book allowed children to better understand how hard life was in the past. By keeping the harsh language, I feel as if people realize how much harder times were.      Books, music, movies, and magazines will always contain a statement that someone doesn't agree with, and by removing that I feel like one can not fully understand the message the author is trying to get across. For all of these reasons, I proudly say that I believe that these different books, movies, lyrics, and magazines should be kept on the shelves	5
4081	Do believe that any boook or form of literature should be removed from a library just because someone takes it into offense? No, it should not be removed. That person should clearly just not read the book or let their children read the book. They have a problem with the book, not everyone else if the book was good enough to be published that means someone wants to read the book which means they would make others who want the book upset over their own opinion.       In the words of Katherine Paterson, a famous author, she says,'All o fus can think of a book that we hope none of uor children or any children have taken off the shelf. But i fI have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 she means by that is everyone has their own opinion on every piece of material that hits stores and libraries. If we shall let everyone choose to take these materials off the shelf then we might as well have no books, music, movies, magazines, etc at all because someone somewhere will always not like the material.     If someone finds something offensive they should simply stay away from it. Everyone has their own view of everythings they come across which means if you hate something, your neighbor might love it. So simply because the boo or other form of material offend you that doesn't mean that its worth taking off the shelves of libraries and book stores.     Don't get me wrong I believe in some forms of censorship. I just don't believe in people taking their opinion and choosing whether a certain piece of literature or music can be in our libraries. I just believe that our libraries are a place where authors can express themselves and share their book, novels, poems, etc.      I believe that if something is offensive to you that's your opinion and there's an easier way to not hav eyour children read the than getting the book removed, just don't bring the book to your children stay away from the book as much as possible. If you @MONTH1 come across it just don't acknowledge it. Your children are more at risk of being in a carcrash then reading a nonapropriate book only if you teach them correctly, not to sound harsh but to shine reality on the fact. That is why I do not believe in censorship in libraries nor bookstores	4
3536	Do I think offensive materials should be removed from libraries? No, I think that if a person is offended by it then they should not get it. They should ignore it and find something else of interest to them. If the person complains about a book, music,movies or anything then they  should not go to the library. I think if people get offended over a book or something like that and complain, they shouldn't be aloud in the library.     When I was in seventh grade we took a field trip to the city library. I thought it was fun because it looked awsome inside. I was walking around searching for a book about animals because all the seventh graders had to research an animal. When I was looking, I saw a guy yelling at one of the librarians. He was a guy of color and he was complaining because he read a book about slaves. He was offended by it cause his grandfather was a slave. I read the book and I thought there was nothing offeensive about it because it told about the slaves having to do hard work, then eventually they got free.        My opinion is that offensive materials should not be removed from libraries. People that do not think they are offensive will read them. If a person thinks that a book is offensive then they should just walk away and find a different book. That's why I think offensive materials should not be removed from libraries.	3
4547	I do believe that we can have Materials because there are some good materianls thats have some good stuff in that.Book yes if we don't have no book we can't leave. If we don't have book how we people know how to read.Music i will said yes and no because some time music is not good but some time people need music to do they work. I will say know to magazines because it be to much in that.It be stuff thin them that @CAPS1 sould not see.	2
3369	All kid's have their own style of books, @CAPS1 people like scary, funny, or romance books, but can we really take that to an offense? We should think of how taking @CAPS1 books off the shelf would affect more then one person, @CAPS1 people @MONTH1 be mature enough to read the more 'grown up' books or magazines, libraries have all types of syles for different people, you just might have to look a little harder to find the right book for you.         I do not agree that @CAPS1 books and or magazines can be taken offensive. All libraries are different  types of books,for example  an elemantry school library they will not have grown up or teenager books, and a middle school will not have little kid books. We also have to think does peer presure effect what books or magaiznes kids read? , for example when I was in middle school my friends were all reading romance books, and I was still reading @ORGANIZATION1, and I had to change my reading style to fit in, so that's exactly what I did.      Books that have offensive content shouldn't be taken off the shelf, I believe that if there is 'offensive' books in your library, just ignore them you @CAPS2't have to get that book, we cant just take the more grown up books out because @CAPS1 kids @CAPS2't know what their suppose to be reading. Libraries have all different style of books to fit everyone's taste, so just look for that right book that suites you, and @CAPS2't take all the books that have an offensive style of the shelf, @CAPS2't judge a book by it's cover	3
3863	I believe everyone has the right to voice there own oppinion on life. If we censor ones books, music, or movies because they are inapropriate, it would be like silencing an oppinion that stands out among the others. If we silence the author and there story or song how will we be able to view life in another persons view?     In the @ORGANIZATION1 we have the freedom of speech and press. these amendments make it so that otheres can voice an oppinion with out being shot down. Although we have the amendments there are still restrictions on what we are aloud to publish. Say we found a diary writen by @PERSON1? Are we aloud to view his deepest darkest thoughts? or Are we going to say that it is too dark and depressing for the average person's eyes. His ideas are different, does that mean we shouldn't show them? no we should show them, we need to educate people that there are indeed different ways of viewing life.     I believe that no matter whos ideas it is, if aloud by the author, should be aloud to be read and comprehend in our own way.     If one wishes to learn about how to murder in a @CAPS1 then i think they should be aloud to do so. The reason why; The @CAPS1 is becoming absolete, the technology era is officially here. There is not a thing we can't find in @CAPS1 that can't be found online.      Although the @CAPS1 is a government run facility, many people will go elsewhere to find the materials wanted to view the censored media. It is true that if we allowed 'censored' material into a @CAPS1 a child could find it. But like the internet you can block things from those kids.     All voices need to be heard, even if it is racist, sexist, biest, or just insane. these are ways to view the persepective or the reason behind hate and war. if we can learn from other mind sets through books, music, movies and movies, then i think we should be aloud to.     Nothing should be blocked from the public. Every one has the right to voice there own oppinion through there own way.	3
3677	There are thousands of books in libraries, which are inapproriate and some that are. But libraries are to learn about many things such as reading for fun, reading the newsletter, or just looking for  random information. Libraries are places that we refer to when we need to find historical moments, or about animals or anything else. We need all books because they teach us the past, they all have a purpose, and we become more intellegent.       I believe that all books in a library have a purpose. They @MONTH1 be offensive but they teach us many things. For example, there are books out there that talk about the @CAPS1. For some people this @MONTH1 be a touchy subject and some might take it offensively, but if we didn't have those books to learn from we would make the same mistakes as we did back then. Books can teach us so much about the past, we can learn so many things from books then anywhere else in the world.      I also think that all books have a purpose to them. whether they are fiction or nonfiction. You @MONTH1 ask 'how do fiction books have purpose?' @CAPS2, fiction books have a purpose because they teach us to really use our imagination, quite a bit of books make us relieze that the struggles of a character can be the same struggles of someone in real life. And the most important reason is because fiction books not only catch our attention, but they also catch our childrens attention. Fiction books are the first books children know how to read, this is where they start their reading skills.      My last reason for why I don't think 'offensive' books shouldn't be removed from shelves is because all books make us more intellegent. We learn so much information from all sorts of books. Another example would be, that @CAPS3 books could be 'offensive' as @CAPS2, but if we didn't have them we would not have intellegent doctors. My final reason why I disagree with books being removed if they aren't suited for everyone is that someone that wants to learn something wouldn't be able to because what they want to learn could be offensive to others. What I mean by this is that we would pretty much be telling that person that they are not able to learn something new because others think it's offensive.     Every human being has a different outlook on something that could be offensive or could not. But why should we remove books, magazines, movies, etc from shelves? Just because we don't like it doesn't mean we have to remove it. Everyone has different taste, we wont ever agree on anything. But removing books from shelves isn't fair to anyone. Yes, they @MONTH1 be unsuited for others but when we don't like some thing don't we just move along to something we do like? Yes we do, so we should do the same thing with books	4
4011	Dear @CAPS1,     @CAPS2 the world there are people who censor what their people read and write, these works are oftenly produced by communist and socialist governments. Here in @LOCATION1 we have the right to say,read, and write what we want,about anybody or anything. Censoship does exist in the @LOCATION1, and it is in the form of opoion that it exists.     I have read artricles in the paper about how text books have covered up the truth,due to what is politicaly correct. I have heard of libaries taking down books that have a very strong political opoion, often these are books written by conservitives.I have read about books coming out with the only intention of slamming,proabable presidential nomanees. Being a conservitive myself,I do not believe that these books should not be in book stores,libaries, or other public venues.     I believe this because in @LOCATION1 we have freedom of press and,for these books not to reach the public is against that right and,the free-flow of ideas.You @MONTH1 ask way I believe this? I believe this because I too want others to hear and read about my ideas, on how to obtain life,liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.      Now that @PERSON1, is why all books should be in our libaries.I agree with a restricted section where certain books should be stored,so little children will not get a hold of @NUM1 I would like this paper to put an article out about these thoughts. We the @ORGANIZATION1 are a republic,and we for over @NUM2 years have encouraged the free-flow of ideas.Why stop now?thank you @PERSON2	3
3913	@CAPS4 I think all books,music,movies,magazines,etc. should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. The reason I say this is because what if their are little children that are willing too read grown up books and its all types of naked pictures and words thats not in a child vocabulary. Then they will pic up bad habbits and then use them with knowing what the words actually means.  Then, I think music should be edited because somer music has cursing and talking about things that a young minded child or children shouldn't hear. The music should only be something children are suppose too listen too things that are in their age group.    Next, I believe movies should be censored because now a days we are letting are children watch every and anything they want too. Things that doesnt control their language such as(@CAPS1 @CAPS2). I believe that @CAPS3 sahow needs too be blocked because they really do and say exclusive things on that show, and alot of childern watch and repeat every thing they hear and see of that show. Finally, magazines...I say @CAPS4 too magazines because they have neaked girls and men on the covers and pages of these magazines that shows just way too much and they put things in the magazines too them look real when they are actually not. I think that etc.. should only be used when needed too research and do homework because children use enternet too watch exclusive things and listen too such bad things.    Inconclusion, All together I think it should be an limit too everything we listen too and watch. Because children pick up everything they hear and see	3
3279	Some people ask, '@CAPS1 books should be censored from libraries?' @CAPS2 are always parents who think that the libraries have books that are inappropriate for their kids, so they speak out against the library and tell them to censor or remove the books. I believe that in order for a library to censor or remove books, magazines, movies, music, etc., it depends on @CAPS1 the subject matter of those things are about.      It's also the parent's job to monitor @CAPS1 their kids read, listen to, or watch. @CAPS2's no reason for a library to censor and take away books because one or two parents complain that it's inappropriate, when the parent can just pull their kids away from the book or movie and move on to something else. It's not the libraries job to watch kids and make sure they don't read, listen to, or watch anything bad. It's the parent's job.      Katherine Paterson, an author, had a good point, also. She said that if she has the right to take books off the shelf, then so does everyone else. If everyone else starts taking books off the shelf, we have no books left. Everyone has a different view of books. @CAPS1 one person thinks is bad, another @MONTH1 not. It goes the other way, too: @CAPS1 one person thinks is good, another @MONTH1 think is bad. On the subject of movies, @CAPS2 are some that should be censored, like the movies containing extreme violence or gore. I remember going to the library when I was a kid, and I wanted to check out a @CAPS3 movie. I couldn't check it out because I wasn't at least @NUM1. I though it was ridiculous because it was only a @CAPS3 movie, and it was harmless.      With magazines and music, it depends on the subject matter of those as well. Some magazines contain inappropriate pictures and articles for young kids, and it's those things that should be kept away from the kids. They don't neccessarily need to be censored or taken away, just kept in another section for teens and adults. The music poses a problem, though. A lot of the music these days can be very inappropriate, especially rap music. Music that sends negative messages and contains a lot of cursing in the lyrics should be censored, in my opinion. It doesn't belong in a library environment where young kids are roaming around and where they're influenced by it.      In conclusion, books, music, movies, and magazines should or should not be censored or removed based on the subject. It just depends on @CAPS1 the subject is about and how inappropriate it is. @CAPS1 one parent thinks is bad, another @MONTH1 not. Overall, I think that books, music, movies, and magzines shouldn't be censored. Parents can just decide @CAPS1 they want their kid(s) to read, watch, or listen to	4
4324	I think that any book or movie should have some warning sighns apon it, to insure that all peaople know what they are going to experience before reading or seeing anything. sSome movies or books read or watched, should have an age limit too. Some of the things people find offensive, other people @MONTH1 not and if taken all of the stuff out of movies or books @MONTH1 cause people not to go see or read as much movies or books.      In alot of music some things might be offensive, but if you don't apriciate what they say in the song then dont listen to that group. There are some rap artist that say some things people might not like but, you dont have to listen to them there are alot more bands and diffrent kinds of music to choose from. It would b hard taken stuff out of movies and music like that because it might take alot of what the people want to see.     In magazines alot of people including i like hearing the trooth about celebrities and interesting facts about people and movies, that alot of people @MONTH1 not know. If parents dont like there children reading those kinds of books have them go buy a set that they will enjoy haveing there kids read.	3
3054	Do you believe libraries should remove items some people find offensive? Do you find some items offensive and want libraries to remove them? @CAPS2 is a major problem that many people don't think about often before acting. Here are some situations many people run into:     If one person finds a @CAPS1 offensive but no one else does, should @CAPS2 be removed? Many libraries contemplate whether or not they should remove an offensive item due to some peoples' opinions. This is because they know people like @CAPS2 and they know people don't; they wonder whether or not they should remove the item because a few people find @CAPS2 offensive, (this can range from books, music, movies, magazines, etc.). People often think they do what is best for everyone by asking the library staff to remove something they think is offensive. Honestly, they're only helping the people that want to have @CAPS2 removed and don't say anything, that is if the library removes the offensive item.     If the library removes the offensive item, they @MONTH1 lose a customer, if they don't remove the item they @MONTH1 lose a customer. So they are faced with a dillemma, 'remove the item or don't remove the item?' @CAPS2's a tough decision to make especially when they @MONTH1 lose more than a few customers based on either choice. So what do they do? They @MONTH1 poll the customers and see what they think, they @MONTH1 do nothing at all, or they @MONTH1 remove the item to keep the person happy. The problem is what happens if @CAPS2's a friend who liked the item and you don't want to hurt their feelings because the item has been there forever and they love @CAPS2 so much, but can't afford to buy @CAPS2 at a store. What do you do then? People often don't want to think of other people's' feelings and/or the decisions they would have to face over something as small as 'an offensive' item, and they say things that they wouldn't normally say just to get said item 'out of their sight.' @CAPS3 is they just don't want to agknowladge other people's' choices, feelingings, opinions, etc.     So what would you do if you found an offensive item at the library? Would you ask for @CAPS2 to be removed? Say nothing? @CAPS2 is your choice in the end, but not all people have the same tastes in books, music, movies, magazines, etc. that you do. So think about other people's' possible feelings, thoughts, opinions in mind before making a decision.	3
4025	'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 quote from @PERSON1 voices a strong point on citizenship. Censorship happens everywhere you are. Whether its a book, a magazine article, or even a tv show things are censored. Censoring things doesn'@CAPS7 make anything more enjoyable, but infact makes less things enjoyable.     I think that things that are offensive should niot be removed from the shelf. Censorship diasble the viewer and or reader to be able to enjoy the full potential of things. I myself watch tv shows all of the time. When the censor things it makes me angry. I already know what the words are so why censor it. @PERSON2 wrote a famous book called @ORGANIZATION1. and that books has been banned from being taught in schools simply because it says a racial term. I have two things to say about it. One if it offends you then you shouldn'@CAPS7 watch or read it. Second one would have to consider the time and age that the book has taken place and that was language used back then. So then one could take in thoght when the book was written, what was the time of when the book had taken place, ect.     There are two books that I read called the @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 @NUM1. Both books have one thing in common. The use of censorship in their society. In @CAPS3 @NUM1 books are censored. @CAPS1 causes one to challenge that concept because he and others felt that it wasn'@CAPS7 fair for books to be banned. Also in the @CAPS2 a boy challenges his @CAPS6 society because they too censored certain things. Censorship also happens in todays' media. Some example are @CAPS7.V shows. TV censors vulgar language, and sometimes violence and gore. Now its understandable to censor childrens shows but shows for mature audiences are unacceptable. Considering the freedom of speech one can express. Also mature shows are only ment for mature people to watch them so why censor them?     Katherine Paterson makes a valid point in her quote. I feel that if you find something to be offensive then don'@CAPS7 read or watch it. If you feel that something is so offensive to you that you have to compell otheras in to believings what you think then you are wrong. People should have the right to read, watch, or listen to anything they want uncensored.	4
3396	First of all, Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, magazined, etc, should be remove from the shelves if they are found offensive, thats question should not be ask ever in life.      Why beacuse there are many people out there that read read stuff and listen to stuff that you might not like at all. when i first saw this question i answer to my self that, ''That if all people think the same way this world would be boring, and i answer the question by saying that there should not be any books remove or music remove, from any shelves' why beacause we all don tlike the same thing or do the same thing.     In first place, I know that there are many different kind of thing that people beacause they love doing it and some dont do those kind of things beacause they really dont like or dont care about it. This is answering the question about removing books, music, or magazines from shelves even if the article the book, music, etc, say's or if its offensive to other people, that is not a reason to remove stuff. There are thing that you enjoy doing and things that you emjoy reading, listening, and looking, etc that other people dont like or hate about it.     In second place, not only beacause you dont like something people should stop doing those things or stop buying those thing, NO!!, that is not the case here @CAPS1. or @CAPS2. you should not care just for you or do what ever is right for you. If you are a good person that wants to be someone in the future dont just care about you care about the other too, beacause you'll need those person or those book in the future when ever your falling down.     In my conclusion, about this article. I think that people should not remove any thing from any library even if its found offensive to other people, those thing help other in life to do what they really want to do, while other are getting hurt for those offensive this that are writting on a little peace of paper. Hope this latter help you all think about and change your decision about this case, hope you all make the right decision that would not affect anyone in general.     Thank you for taking your time to ready what I really think about removing articles from libraries	3
4659	'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Katherine Paterson, an author, once said. I think that she was trying to tell us that some books should not be out on the shelves for children to read. I agree with her on that statement.     I have once read a book with very mature content. It was very vulgar and not sutable for my age or maturity. There are a lot of books like that out there and we need to hide them from the children of our society. They are too young to hear or read about adult actions such as: war, violence, sex, drugs, and all sorts of other things.     If we take these mature books and other types of media off the shelves our children will have better lives. There would be less teen pregancies, drug ussage, and multiple other factors that are effecting our society. Children would behave better because they would not be so greatly influenced by the media. I think that we shouldn't get rid of these book though. We should just keep them out of the libraries. If people want to read these kinds of books they should search elsewhere. An easy way to solve this problem is to put an age limit on books and media of this content and to put them in a separate store or section in the libraries.     A very great author said that children should not be exposed to adult content in the media. But she also said that the people who read or watch this type of media have every right to. This is why there needs to be an age limit on this type of media. But for now if the content is to adult for you or does not agree with you, don't read or watch it.	3
4233	All terms of offense are based on an opinion. If one person finds a particular word offensive, doesn't mean the next guy will feel the same way. Some parents aren't as strict on there kids as others, and some just dont care.      Of course there's always that gangster rap that talks about drugs and women being objectified that kids really dont need to belistening to. The horror movies that are rater ''@CAPS1' for a reason, they could have nightmare for weeks. Children's mental states aren't fully developed at a young age like ten. They still cant tell whats real and whats not. They need a trusted adult to rely on to tell them how to feel, to act, to do, even to think. Children just are't mature enough to handle a mojority of material in this world. No books should be taken away or hiddne fvrom society, it should just be given to you at your own disgression. Another possiblility would be have a group of many people gather and vote on age restrictions for particualr material. All information is helpful, just not all is necessary.     These days its hard to hide all harmful material from children, even some teenagers. This wolrd is becoming less and less sensitive everyday. Eventually everyone will be completly insensitive to all 'harmful' movies, books ,amgazines, @CAPS2 shows, and music. It wont even phase anyone anymore.	3
3974	I do not think that censoship has a ightful place in our librares. I know that libraries were created to be information! hubs for the public. If censorship were put in place, then many books would be gone as they @MONTH1 be seen as offensive to a  minority of people................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................	2
3330	Eventually, everyone sees or hears offensive things. However, the government has taken it upon themselves to try and keep youth from seeing it. They believe the parents should tell their children about everything while they try to make it one big secret for kids. But, if kids are introduced early, we would not have to keep it a secret anymore. Libraries and all types of media should not be censored.      Kids always ask questions like 'where do babies come from?' and adults, wanting to avoid an awkward conversation, make up stories or do not tell them the whole truth. Imagine a world where the government let the media say whatever they want. Yes, at first it would be vulgar but the government would then have the right to teach about sex and drugs in school. More kids would be educated, so less of them would be curious enough to do any of that stuff.     That is not to say that newscasters should curse everytime they are on television. It is merely suggesting that instead of having a metaphorical black curtain over half the news, they report the whole truth. They have freedom of speech, and we have a right to know.     At first, people would think it was a terrible world. But, eventually, with right leadership, it would help make a more truthful environment. Kids would learn about sex and drugs in school, and have a safe environment to answer their questions if they have any. Drug use and rape would go down. Then, talking about 'offensive' topics would be non-existent so kids would not be embarassed if they had questions. This would change the world for the better.	3
3177	The way i see it movies or books shouldnt be taken off the shelf .becouse it should be up to ower own right to take a movie or to tonot take the movie .Also music such as country or sad music ant like movies or books how can u take music of the radio u canot do it .Becouse it dnt matter what u do with the radio shut it off turn it down or change the chanel with the way the world is now days there will all ways be things on the radio that u wont wanna hear and there will be things that u do wanna hear ,thats my opinion about movies and music      Also if there was any way to keep movies away i would probaly have it done there are goood movies and there are bad but one movie that is afensive and shy is (shylo) about the old man hittin the dog and stuff thats verry afensive to some one that was raised around beetings.	1
3229	Have you ever been looking for a book only to find it band from all local stores? Well I haven't had the misfortune of being in that situation, but I could only imagine the sheer distress of wanting but not finding that controversial book. I personally think that a young adult should be able to read any book or news article that they wish to. The fact that a book is found offensive of offputing to most is no reason to completely ban the book from store and library shelves alike, because if there is @CAPS5 one person that could educationaly benefit from reading this book then they should at least have a chance to obtain that information.      One of the most impotant things to remember while considering this topic is that no matter what the source is or what it conveys there will always be someone that feels the book is just to graphic of hits to close to home for them to stand. In other cases however, there are books that are not proper for younger children or the faint of heart, such as the book series 'The @CAPS1 @CAPS2' in which people are thrown into an arena and forced to fight each other for their very lives. Most people who are above the age of twelve can handle almost all of the 'offensive sources' that are atainable by the public, but there are some cases that @CAPS5 adults cannot handle such as the famous  book that @PERSON1 wrote in incarseration called ' @CAPS3 @CAPS4.' @CAPS5 in those extreme cases most adults can the read.      Now that my argument has been said and you know my point of view is that it veries from person to person whether they can handle a book I ask you if feel the same way that I do. My main reason for this conclusion is that if someone thinks a book is too offensive they should simply avoid this book. We do live in @LOCATION1 the land of the free, I think we can a little controversy over a book or magazine. I do hope that in the future we as a nation can overcome these small setbacks that are caused by an over reaction to something offensive. I believe that we will see a day that no book will be band from the shelves, so that our children @MONTH1 gain the knoledge that is contained by thoes fragile pages of paper	4
3217	Whispers and comments fill the room while people make their way throughout the library. The critialzing of books and materials that are neatly stacked in the shelves, are taken and miss treated from the harsh people that think they are offensive. In my point of view, I strongly agree that there is no right to argue about what should or should not be removed in the libraries.      The reflecting of my own views along with the libraries, shows intertest in the materials for people all over the world. The reason that I, myself, do not believe in this situation is how it mentioned in Katherine Paterson's passage. It explained, 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 everybody around has a unique part about themselves, and that is having a different look on something than someone else might have. This leads into taking a material or book they see, the wrong way and being offensive about it. However, there might be someone else that does not view that same exact book is wrong, but instead, see's something else that could lead to be offensive to them as well.      To make this observation not as confusing, I will share my own experience that might help focuse more on my argument. There is a time when I went to the library and saw books and especially magazines throughout, that had an impact on colored people. It described how it would be like, if there was still slavery and that if everybody wasn't taught or treated equal amongst everyone else. In this situation, it could go both ways on how colored people tend to look and feel about this. Maybe the people are relieved and interested, knowing they are free now. On the other hand however, many colored people might get in an awkward position, having no passion of bringing the equiality up in the present world, or even the future. Many might want to forget about what happened, instead of books and magazines still publishing articles and stories about it. Again, this argument might go both ways, meaning one less book would be off the shelf, or many would be newly stacked aside from the others.     When people think of materials, they most likly think of something that symbolizes an event, time period, or a symbol itself. This could also have an impact on the censorship in libraries. The way people want to take roll in the things they are part of, might actually be found in the library. However, someone that thinks there is no right for it to be shown, will remove the material. This tends to make the people that thought it was right, not find the interest they wanted to recieve.     Another arugment people might have is that libraries are a public place, right? Well this should cut back or maybe even add more pull into what they can or can not share within their readings, materials, and movies. People might think that they have a right to argue or take the offensive actions out. Not so quick though as people can prove that they can put anything back as well. Well, instead of picking and choosing, I think everything should be left alone and people should only go to the section of interest they are looking for and leave the other materials out of their view.     My experience and observations about this argument has covered why I, and all of you, should reflect on the views of censorship the approperiate way in libraries. Not saying this will control all the problems, but it will help from removing all of materials that could have a big roll in future process of taching children, teachers, and of course, each and everyone	4
4658	Hello @ORGANIZATION1, I am writing to talk about censorship in libraries. In libraries they have tons of materials that have language and images that are offensive. i have a broad view on this subject. My view is just that if the censor stuff in a library, the should censor tv.     I have deaf parents, so we always have the captions on in our house. Everyday I see bad language thats inot censored. I also have seen images that are not censored. The youth of this time mostly watch tv than use the library. So why not censor tv. I see things on tv that i wont see in a library.     In my conclusion i would like to say i dont believe that libraries should censor their materials because the studdent will still find out. There are plenty of other places that are worse. Like crimes scenes, cime scens have blood and gore and a library would just have language. These are my views ancd yours could be differnt.	3
4724	I belive that every one has thier right to thier own opinion.  If a parrent does not think that thier kid should do some thing dont let them. It kind of reminds me of how people are aginst hunting if you dont like it dont do it.     If every one would express thier own opinion the world would be alot better place.  If I dont like @PERSON1 and I tell @PERSON1 i dont like him @PERSON1 knows I dont like him so he wont talk to me any more.  So in a bigger picture if @LOCATION1 tells @LOCATION2 that we dont like thim they will not try to make friends with us any more.  so if everyone would speak thier mind the world would be alot better.     If a parent does not like some thing like a type of music, movie, or even book and they express that to thier kid they will learn that that thing is bad.  My dad tought me that it was fine to kill animals only if I am willing to eat them so that seams fine with me but other people might not think its right.  So I belive that if your not a hipocrite and live as you teach your kids to that your kids will listen to you.     As I have said before my dad tought me that its fine to kill animals if I am willing or going to eat them.  I find one exception to this rule cyotes (we have alot of cyotes where i live at and they can be a pest).  I belive that that is about the only exception to the rule because cyotes are problem animals in this area.     So if you dont want your kids watching rated @CAPS1 movies then block them on tv. Its the same thing with the other things like the magazines, books and music.	3
4667	Censorship in librarys can be a positive and negative thing. I think this because there can be somethings that you @MONTH1 not want your children to read. But there also can be things that you do want them to read. Age groups can play a big role in censorship because there are things that you dont want to see a kid reading when he or she is young. But if it is censored then they will not even be able to read it when they get older. It all depends on what kind of things are in the books, music, movies, and magazines.     If you find something offensive that you read in a book or saw in a magazine to some people that @MONTH1 not be offensive at all. This is why I think that the censorship can be good and bad. I am sure that there @MONTH1 be somethings that you have read that wasn't offensive to you but it @MONTH1 still be offensive to others. Censorship in my opinion can be a good thing when the things that are in the book, movie, magazine, and music are not true and that @MONTH1 be offensive to more than a small group. Lets say that there are two books written about the same true topic. The first books material is very well written and @MONTH1 have offensive material in it here and there. The second book is also well written but @MONTH1 not all be there the whole story @MONTH1 not be the same as what happened because they censored it because it can't be in the library. Which would you rather read? Personally I would rather read the book that @MONTH1 have some offensive material but has the complete story of what happend.     Say you were the writer of a book and it took you a long time of hard work and dedication to finish the book and get it published. Would you want your book to be on the shelf at the library? I know I would but if your writing about something that happend in your life that could have been offensive to others they @MONTH1 not allow that book on the shelf of a library. If the things that are in the book are true or are in real life. Than why show your children a book that isn't true? Im not saying go get your child a war book and have them read it when they are very young. When reading a book that someone spent a long time and lots of hard work on you are looking into their perspective. Maybe there perspective of what happend is alot different than yours, but that can be a good thing. Even with the offensive material books, movies, magazines, and music can still be good to some people and bad to others.     I have went to librarys and found books that I was interested in and I think that some of them could be found offensive to others. If the contents of the book, movie, magazine, and the music are not true and can be found offensive then sure that should be censored. But if it is censored it should only be for a certain age group. I have also went and got books at the library that have true stories that can be found offensive by some people, but that doesn't mean it should be censored. A book that @MONTH1 have material in them that could be 'bad' for some people. That does not mean that after they read it they are going to go start using the same offensive language that could be in the book. It all depends on the persons perspective if they find a book offensive or that has some 'bad' material in it then don't read it, and find something that you wouldnt find offensive.     Overall the things that we read, watch, and listen to @MONTH1 not all be bad even if it has some offensive material in it. To some it can be bad to others it can be part of their life. If I had a story to tell and I spent a long time working on it. I would want it to be read, seen, and heard. Censorship @MONTH1 be good for some and bad for others. If you are a person that allways likes a happy ending then maybe censorship is good. But if you want the whole story that can be non-fiction or fiction then censorship is not for you.	4
4254	Dear @CAPS1,     @CAPS2 I have found that there has been a strong censorship in the libraries and I would like to express my strong disagreement for these actions. I have found that things have been removed from your shelves due to its content. Some of the content is vulgar and explicit and some is very offensive, but that still does not give you the right to remove these things. Books, movies, music, and magazines are very big parts of peoples lives and removing these things can be a big part of someones development.      First off you should not be taking books off of shelves for any means. There is a reason these books have been written and published nad it is because they have some meaning and can teach people or give them information on things they would not know otherwise. Taking books off shelves is pretty much just sheltering people, mostly kids, from information that would benefit them no matter in what way. Yes some books talk about sex, and yes some books have offensive terms but unless children are exposed to things like this they will not know that it is wrong. If they do not read books about how slaves were treated, they will never know about the slaves. If they never read a book about a married woman having an affair, they won't understand the significance of cheating. When people read these things they learn about them, and with a little common sense they can understand these things are wrong. Books should not be taken off the shelves in a @CAPS1 at any rate and movies should be looked at in the same manner.     Movies now a days have come along way. Flicks like @CAPS3 and @CAPS4 use such a high form of technology that people would have no idea how it was done just a few decades ago. Some movies due contain very vulgar language and offensive terms and sometimes even nudity, and I can relate to not wanting a little child to see that. This does not mean that these things should be removed from the @CAPS1 though. In all honesty I do not want my little brother or sister walking past a @CAPS5 container with a picture of a girl in lingerie on the front and I do not think anyone else is ok with that. Other movies should be put on display for kids to rent though. Movies that can teach them history although there is very graphic content. Movies that will help them learn how not to do somethings like kill or rape. Movies that can show these things but also teach how incredibly horrible these things are at the same time. I think that the movies that go past this should be put into an adult only section and I do not think any pornography should be put on display anywhere, but movies need to be available to a very high extent. Movies are very good teaching tools and magazines follow that same path.      In the world today we have magazines like @ORGANIZATION1 that are jam packed with information that can better kids from a young age to even people who have been out of school for a while. I feel like some educational magazines @MONTH1 be graphic and show things that children should not see but on the other hand, seeing it will help them understand. Now I am not saying I want to put @CAPS6 magazines on display for people to see and learn about how little of clothes some girls can wear but magazines that @MONTH1 show the very little amount of clothes people are forced to wear in countries in @LOCATION1. They should be able to view magazines that could show, a little more on the nude side, of people who are starving because they only can eat twice a week. Things like this although can be very offensive maybe to some people should be viewed because it can teach. It will show kids that these people need help and they can be those people that help them. Once again pornography should not be available at anytime but other magazines that have an educational aproach but could contain some naughty things due to the teaching should be able to be heard. Magazines should be available but on the other hand you have to take a more careful approach to music.      Music is probably the hardest to figure out, of these censored things I have spoken of today. People use music to express feelings. Whether those feelings are good or bad they get them out through song. Music is something that brings people together and allows them to be unique at the same time. Music should not be taken away from people going into a @CAPS1 because of its vulgar content or anything of that matter. There is a thing called the 'clean' version of pretty much any song that has curse words in it. Songs that cannot be cleaned up or are not available in that way I can undertstns why they are taken off the sheleves but other than that I think everything should be made available. Music can be so powerful to people and taking it away is not the right thing to do.     In conclusion the censorship should not be done. Yes there are somethings that have to be removed due to the extremeness contained in it but if things can be learned from I feel like it should stay no matter what. People go to a @CAPS1 to learn and there are so many tools that can be used to teach them. Music, movies, magazines, and books can be such a big part of peoples lives and taking these things from them is not right	4
3661	Censorship; the aspect of removing offensive materials from the public eye. Is this the right thing to do? Should society as a whole take away variety? Do you believe our generation or future generations should not get to experience and understand what the past generations have? I believe censorship is wrong in every aspect, but I also believe that materials that are offensive, or unappropiate for certain ages can be controlled.      Movie theatres, video stores, @ORGANIZATION1, and television all do it. They use ratings and age control for their viewers. Now control can be difficult, and @MONTH1 not always work if not handled correctly. To handle this situation before it arises, the library can use a system like restaraunts or bars use; such as, checking identification before letting a book that is '@CAPS1' rated or above be checked out. Different sections in the library can be available to certain age groups. Now you @MONTH1 be thinking; doesn't this idea take away from the liberties that libraries give us? Well you @MONTH1 be right, but you would rather have our children see violence and other inappropiate materials that they shouldn't? It would be just like the movie theatre. You would not need to buy a ticket, but the control of content would be phenomial compared to what it is. Would you want your six year old girl picking up an adult violence movie, sexual content movies, or even a @CAPS2 with cursing in it? Why should the library offer things for children that parents would frown upon?      I believe the library should be a place of learning and freedom, but the learning should be something age appropiate. Our society is maturing too fast for young children, why should the library take part in that? Libraries located in schools do not even offer this material because they know that the majority of the readers' for their library are students. This being said why should public libraries be okay with stocking this material.      Yes, media is everywhere. Movies, books, magazines, newspapers, music, and much more flash and sell more than they should. Media shows children things they shouldn't know about until they are young adults, but does this make it okay? Does it make is right for children to see and want all they want to? No, it does not. Fighting fire with fire only makes a larger fire. Why start our children out at a young age with violence, sex, and inappropiate material? Would you like to set your children up to fail? I know I wouldn't so why let our libraries hand out books, magazines, movies, and more to let our children thrive upon the culture they are stuck with? I do not think we should remove these books from our libraries because everyone has a different opinion, but I do believe that control needs to be put into place for our children's and other children's sacks. With that being said, censorship is overrated, but some of the material at the library are underrated, and that needs to be handled and controlled	4
4515	I agree with Katherine's statement, but to a certain extent. If a book or magazine has cursing or anything offensive in it, then a student should take it to the librarian and let him/her know they are offended by it. Especially if it's in a middle school or elementary school.      Of course there's going to be a book or movie or magazine that has something inappropriate in it. One day my friend and I were in the library looking for a book to read, and that's when I first discovered the @CAPS1 series. But as I got into the books, the more mature they got. In the last book, @ORGANIZATION1, it has a lot of profanity in it. But that doesn't mean I'm not mature enough to not know what it means. Same with any other high school student. But you can't protect your children from everything. Not even curse words.     So if you see a book at a local library that is absolutely filled with offensive things, and you decide you want it removed, just take it to your librarian and comfront him/her. I'm sure they'll understand. Or maybe they won't, and they'll wait to see if anyone else will want it removed. My point is, you can't always protect your children from violent words or movies, or magazines. But you can always stand your ground and try	3
4002	Libraries should or should not have books, music, magazines that are found offensive? Some people like things that are different than what you or anyone else like you @MONTH1 think some of the things are offensive, but yet again something you don't like someone else @MONTH1 like, and want to read. Would if be fare to you that you like something, and want to read it, but someone else dose not like, and thinks that it offens them, and they should take it off a shelf at a public library because of what that person said.      I don't think that thinks like that should be taken off a shelf for something like, becasue there could be a person in school that needs soemthing like that is not right for a child to be looking at,but what if there is a kid in high school or collage that needs a book to do a project over that type of things, but also yes I do think that things that little kids should not be looking at or listening or reading something like should not be able to get a hold of because parents should not have to worry about them going to a librariy, and there children see something that they do not want them to see. There are vary many ways that people that work in the libraries can keep things up from children that is to little to see or hear what there parents do not want them too. Some ways that you can do that is by putting all the books and music that is like that in a section of the library that you have to be a sertent age to be able to go look or listen to them.      Lubraries are for everyone no matter what you look like or dress. You as a person has the right to go in to a public library and look for something to read no matter if it has some curse words or some violence in the reading. If you are reading those kinds or books you should be machure for your age and not have to worry about it. You hear and see everything that you read about today so I don't see the difference in if a child hears or sees it beacuse you see it just about every where you go now days. You really can not get away with out dealing with it	3
3110	Do I think that certain materials such asd books, music, movies,magazines,etc., should be removed froom libraries, no, because people might need to know a certain information, certain lessons are taught in different sources, all sources are liabilities.     Now, you just @MONTH1 need certain information, and in those sources there are an unnumbered amount of lessons to learn. For example if were to go in a library an need a book on religion I would need a book or movie to teech me on that particular subject, or even sex I would need a magazine or move to watch to know new information.     There are different lessons taght in different aspects. For example some people learn by example, movies, music, and magzines. I it were to be me lokking for a source on music theory I might need one of those things to get what i need.     Finally, those things are liabillities. Don't get me wrong like we need them on a daily bases, but in a sense we sort of do. We use search engines for everything, everyday. so what do you think.     In conclusion i believe we need those sources because, someone @MONTH1 need certain information, there are diffferent lessons learned and taught in different things, a lastly ALL sources are liabillities	3
4247	I think censorship of certain materials, books, music, magazines, etc., that are offensive should be removed from people who have yet to mature, unless a parent or gardian approves of it.     I think censorship can be a positive things for little children and younger folk because kids that are young of age should not view or listen to things such as bad things. These things can be a negitive influence on the child's character and personallity.    No one should hear other kids cursing in public becuase this can influence other kid to do the same. I know my parents don't want to hear me say or do bad things around my younger siblings becuase this can influence them more to do it too than if some kid was saying or doing bad things.      Some censorship shouldn't be aloud to those who are matuered, such as in high school where you have to get a signature from a parent to see some things that should not be shown to little kids becuase older people have matured and they understand why not to be a bad influence on people.     Censorship of certain materials, books , musicm magazines, ect., that are offensive should be removed from people that have yet to mature, unless with parrent concent. People who have not matured should not view or listen to any thing that is a negitive influence on themselves.	2
3435	This statment is not right. Peolpe should be alound to read what ever they went or linst to or watch what ever movie they went. When someone read somthing thats bad they @MONTH1 or not like it. So people should not take away books, movies,and music that are bad.      One thing that peolpe should have a choose of what they read and other stuff. Books some people like reading bad stuff beacuse they enjoy it. If the person do not like it they should put back and find somthing else to read. Now movies are a lot of fun to watch. But when you watch a new movie you should rent it first to see if you like the offensive sence or not. And the age thing yay you should watch a movie with andult if your to young. Now music is one thing that is offensive should not be takn off the shelves. Becasue if you dont like it do not pick it up from the shelves and tell people thats bad music when it could be some great music. Ok there is one thing that can be taken off the shevels is the magazines. Its bad for people to be reading those tip of magazines. if they went them they should order them offline mail at their house.      So people should not take off the shelves are books, movies, and music but they can take away magzines.People like the books and stoffe that have bad stofe in them. And there should be no taking off the shevels. Thats what i think of if somone toke somthing off the shelves.	2
3121	I, personally, do not think that books, music, movies, or magazines should be removed from the shelves because they are found offensive. However, I do believe that there should be a way to protect adolescent, still-developing children from reading books that @MONTH1 offend them or introduce them to new concepts or ideas that @MONTH1 hinder their educational growth. Some kids who have not been properly educated over a controvercial topic (such as drugs or alcohol) @MONTH1 make a bad decision based off something he or she reads about in a book or on a webpage.     To help solve the problem of offending children or deterring their education, I propose that we make a book 'rating' system. Similar to rating a movie or a video game, this system would rate the book so that readers know what age level the book is apropriate for, and state what factors the book incorporates to rate it the way they did.     As a newpaper company, you obviously know about our @CAPS1 of @CAPS2. We, as @CAPS3, have @CAPS2. One of them being freedom of speech, along with freedom of press. With that said, I do not think that taking books labeled as 'inappropriate' off the shelves is a reasonable solution to the issue. I know, that from personal experience, when someone tries to take away my @CAPS2 that I'm entitled to, I get extremely angry. Authors, editors, photographers, and publishers all go through a lot of hard work and long hours to put these books on the shelves. By taking the books off the shelves, I believe that that would be repressing their @CAPS2 as @CAPS3. I know that if I were an author, and my book were taken off the shelf, because someone found it 'inapppropriate' I would be very upset. Taking books off the shelves could possibly cause an author's strike, to protest until their books are allowed to be enjoyed by anyone who wishes to read them.      However, like I mentioned in the second paragraph, I do think that making a rating system for books is a good idea that allows the authors to express themselves fully, and also allows readers to know what controvercial material is in the book without them being affected by the information they would have read without the warning. I would strongly advise you consider my proposal, because it has the potential to prevent future confrontations between authors and the public.	4
3873	Censorship in @ORGANIZATION1 has been around for as long as their has been the various mediums of art. In many cases the censorship @CAPS9 of what many would agree as not suitable material for anyone to create and enjoy. But then in other more serious issues that the censor has deemed not suitable for a certain audience, or even to a whole country. What @CAPS9 it that gives a select few the right to ban any given number of imaginative creations, even if they are in some aspects more lued in nature?     Censorship has and @CAPS9 still a very usefull tool that many governments employ to accomplish a wide variety of tasks, considered to ensure the 'safety' of both our minds and bodies. Some of the more widely know cases of this most despicable tactic of control come from the countries of @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @LOCATION3, @LOCATION4R, @CAPS3 @LOCATION5, and @LOCATION2. In these countries all materials that are deemed potentially hazardous to the wellfare of the @ORGANIZATION2 are heavily policed and in many cases destroyed. The most noteworthy instances of this occured in @LOCATION3, where the @CAPS4 would gather up large amounts of books from the people and burn them in massive rallies. The people were so enthralled by the @CAPS5 leadership that they would often times freely relenquish their books with no resistance, and in some cases join in and throw the books in themselves. The same thing @CAPS9 still occuring in @LOCATION5 today, wtih a censor still on their internet surfing possibilities. In @DATE1 the popular search engine @ORGANIZATION3 attempted to set up shop in the country, but quickly entered into dispute with the @ORGANIZATION2 about the censoring of certain materials. Some months after the argument began over the censoring of @LOCATION5's people, the company completely removed all bans for a short time, much to the dismay of the @ORGANIZATION2. During that time it @CAPS9 reported that some of the main search topics were that of many social reformers and of different religions than that of the @ORGANIZATION2's sanctioned religion. But the one country that takes the cake for having the most censorship @CAPS9 @LOCATION2, they're @ORGANIZATION2 has restricted and policed any technology in the country. The common people live in a so called '@CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8'.     In our home country of the @LOCATION1 we are promised many rights to protect our freedom as citizens. We are promised the freedom of speech as well as press, and in censoring our libraries they would restrict both. If we do not stand up and protect our rights, then who will? Are we not a @ORGANIZATION2 for the people, by the people? Why are we allowing the censorship of our own intellectual creations in a place that was created to provide access to said materials for those who are less fortunate, so they themselves can gain knowledge and understanding. If we as a people were to allow such a blatent restriction on our given freedoms, then we are in no position to have them in the first place. Our country was founded and later almost torn apart by the men and women who were willing to risk it all in order to protect their freedoms in this country. Are we descendants of those same people? If so why should we allow ourselves to squander what was hard fought for and earned by our forefathers.     The censor often poses a few questions that do cause one to wonder '@CAPS9 it really better off this way?'. They point out that for every great work of intellegent art, other of a more deviant nature create some more innapropriate pieces of 'art'. Pornography @CAPS9 the most prevalent of their examples, pointing out that if they did not restrict it, then who would stop the hundreds of children that not only roam the libraries bookshelves but also the provided internet services. It @CAPS9 a reasonable question, once that should be take into consideration, but in answer to it I believe that it @CAPS9 and will always be the job of the parent or guardian that bring the child with them. It @CAPS9 simply not enough to drop a child off at the local library and hope they find something interesting. Helping that child find what they want @CAPS9 a journey that should be taken by both the parent and the child. And what about those who believe the censor isn't always right about what @CAPS9 and what @CAPS9 not acceptable for the general @ORGANIZATION1? As author Katherine Paterson once said 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-- that work I abhor -- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'     Censorship has been around for a very long time, and will most likely never be fully cut out of any functioning @ORGANIZATION2. That @CAPS9 sadly an inevibility that cannot be avoided. But the amount that it occurs in your daily life will be directly affected by how much of your freedom you are willing to stand up for.	5
4463	Censorship is just another way to take knowledge from another person or a society. Wanting to take and hide even the smallest of discreet history, politic corruption, and inappropriate sights to a generation can turn them all ignorant and unaware of their past, present, and possibly future.                 Censorship is extremely dangerous to a soceity because it leaves them vulnerable to the future. For example, if people tried to censor @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and many other environmentalist around the globe of the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 possibility, then the world would not be able to have the chance to stop or at least slow the upcoming disaster by going green. Instead, we would most likely die a few hundred years before that deadline. Also, maybe if more people knew about @PERSON2's censorship of his oil distribution among the @LOCATION2 (during his presidency) people might have at least discussed of impeachment.                                                                            Try to think how the future would have been if racism, terrorism, wars, or even an event like the holocaust were censored. That could be taken as brainwashing! Even though that @MONTH1 cause peace and happiness around the world, we still would know nothing of our history leaving us historically, unintellilectual. Then think of all the sudden problem it would cause if that information was suddenly found. In the book series of 'The @CAPS5' by @PERSON1, a city has been isolated from their past, who they call 'the @CAPS6', and they are basically brainwashed to think that they almost destroyed the world by war and destruction by the new government and their new technology.     Luckily, in our own era I do not believe we are censored from most things except of course politics going on between other countries. For example, the @LOCATION1 bin @CAPS7 killing was nothing of anyones awareness except the @CAPS8 of @ORGANIZATION1, military, and @CAPS9. That was a thoughtful choice from @CAPS10 as well instead of announcing it on @NUM1 news. I'd rather of coursebe notified about my history, because it's interesting and it shows why things are now. Books like 'To @CAPS11 a @CAPS12' or '@PERSON3' should never be taken off shelves for young pupils or old matures. Although it would seem a bit more offensive to hearing a historical racist cocasian singing about negroes than a racist book, I would always be interested in hearing about it.     Censorship should definitely be illegal itself in libraries, @CAPS13 stores, and any other selling stores of books, music, movies, and/or magazines. Although, I have not heard of any recent censorships, but then again should I not be able to? It is censorship..	4
3771	Libaries everywhere might have a book or two that @MONTH1 be offensive to a reader. I haven't found a book offensive to my readings just yet. Some people might think that some music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves of the library. But some people are against it, like me. Its going to take more than one person to remove the music, magazines,etc., from the library.     Music in the library is good because you can't find old music like in the @DATE1's in a music store. If someone finds music offensive in the libary it might be because they don't know the history from where the music came from or what the artist has been through. Say for instance the person is offended by hip hop music. I'm sure there's a book for that and the person can look up where the music came from. Maybe then they wouldn't be so offeneded.     Magaizines in the library are really for people who love the media. There are so many magaizines that have interesting facts about what happen or what's going to happen. For example @ORGANIZATION1 has all the newest event or something big that happend, just in that one @ORGANIZATION1. Then there's advertisments, how would people get money if they didn't put there adverstisment in a @ORGANIZATION1 so people could buy there product. If not nobody would buy the products.     Movies in the library are for teachers to show students. Half the stuff in the libary, you can find at blockbuster or walmart. It's because the library has old movies and current events that happened years ago. They might even have a movie to go with the book the reader has read, but some people are more visual with the movie. So they read books.     Overall I hope the music, magazines, and movies stay on the shelves of the libraries and don't change they way the library is doing things. Some books might already be off the shelves that people have complained about or got offeneded by already. So its already too late for that. But its going to take more than one person to be aganist it. So that's my view on taking out music, magazines, and movies out of the library	4
3220	'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our chilren or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf--that work I abhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf.'( Paterson) Katherine Paterson believes that if she can take a book off the shelf that she doesn't like anyone can. That should be the right way, but I don't agree. I don't think people should be able to take a book off the shelf just because they find it offensive. They don't have to take the book.     I don't believe there should be censorship in libraries. If people find a book offensive they don't have to look at it or check it out. Other people might enjoy that book. Likeing a book is an opinion. For exmaple, if someone doesn't like your outfit you're probably not going to go and burn it or throw it away  because that is just that one persons opinion. That is how it goes with movies, books, music, and magazines. Everyone likes something different so their should be different books.      When you don't like a book I beleive the only time it would be right for you to take that book off the shelf would be if it was in your house. Then you can take that book off the shelf and throw it away or whatever you want to do with that book. If you had the whole town vote to get rid of a book and ninety-five percent voted to get rid of that book then I think it would be okay. You can't just think about yourself when it comes to public things, you need to think about the whole community.     I read an article about banning '@PERSON2' from schools, I didn't think that would be a good idea. '@PERSON2' was one of the top picked books by high school students. If parents didn't like their kids reading it they should have just told them not to read it. I don't think it's right for parents to just go in the school and say they didn't like that book and take it off the shelf. I t's not fair to other readers who enjoy reading '@PERSON2 @PERSON2'.     Choosing what book to read is your opinion so you don't have to read a book you dislike. People like all different books so it's not fair for them to not able to read the book they like just because other people don't like the book. What If someone didn't like a book that you loved? Would they just be able to take it off the shelf	3
3056	Many books and material in libaries are sometimes offensive to certian people but that does not mean they should be taken off the shelves of libaries. Material that might be offensive to one person might have a valuable intrest in another person. If you hated the subject of history and had the right to take it away, then someone else might come along and take away a subject you like like, science. If it is offensive to the general public, it should be placed in a special scection, be avaible behind the counter, or avaible only at specific libaries.     Throught the libaries of the world, there are two general sections, adult, kid, and entertaminet sectioons. In these sections locate many topics and many views of ceartian things. Sometimes it is very offensive and it is almost 'hidden' from view and have to spend all day looking for it. It should be that contreverstial topics should be kept in a closed off section of the libary and can be accesed by the staff so that way none of the pubic can worry.      Like cigarretes at a store, somethings should be behind the counter where the material can have a watchfull eye over it. These subjects include sex, racisim, porn, polotics, and other material like the ones listed. With these items behind the counter, people will not know about it and it will be hidden from view, but still acesiable with special order or request. This would help the public.     Some material, when reached to a specific town, can cause an uproar that can shake an entire community. Some material should be denied from entering small towns and the specified material can only be aquired at large libaries or specific book stores. With material far away, people can be reassured in small towns that material will never upset their community. This is why some material should only have premettid acess under watchfull guard	3
4719	'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-- that work I abhor--then you also have exactly yhe same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us,' states Katherine Paterson. Books and movies all over the world are being censored and removed from libraries, day after day, due to their explicit content. I believe that books, movies, and magazines should not be removed from the shelf, and that they are there for a genuine purpose. Explicit objects should not be censored because a human being should have a judgement of their own, children's parents have a right to exclude the material from the child's life, and some material can be useful in life and someone @MONTH1 learn from @CAPS3.      Children everywhere are being influenced by books, magazines, movies, and even songs. Some people argue that these harmful materials are affecting how kids behave and act. I, however, believe that a child should have superb morals and values to know right from wrong. For example, if a child happens to see a pornography magazine lingering on a shelf of their local grocerey store, they should know that no matter how temping @CAPS3 @MONTH1 be, that buying that pornography magazine would be wrong. From birth, parents are constantly teaching their children what is right and what is wrong. They attempt to teach their children the basics: that drugs, alcohol, and smoking will corrupt their health. @CAPS3 doesn't matter if a child sees someone doing drugs in a movie or hears a song about a teenager getting drunk. They should not be influenced by this because by using their logic, they should infer that what is being read or listened to isn't always the right thing to do.     Everyday, children's parents have the right to exclude harmful material from a child's life. After all, they are a superior figure in the child's life, and the child will always look up to them to lead the way. At most local theaters now, you have to be seventeen to see a rated '@CAPS1' movie. A lot of theaters allow a child to view a rated '@CAPS1' movie, no matter what age, as long as they have a parent or a gardian present. Movie theaters feel that by having a child's parent there would help immensly because the parent is choosing for their child to watch that particular movie, instead of the child viewing the movie without their permission. If a parent doesn't want their child to view a raunchy movie, they can simple say, 'NO!' @CAPS3's as simple as that. If a parent feels that a movie is decent for a child to watch, then go ahead and let them watch that material. Parental agreement should always be a main factor in determined whether or not a child could view a particular movie or read a certain provacative book.      If all offensive books and movies were removed from the shelf, we would be living in a structured world where no one would learn any more than what they already knew. Life @MONTH1 possibly become rather boring. Although, some people @MONTH1 find books and songs to be offensive, others @MONTH1 contribute from these materials. A child @MONTH1 pick up a book, start reading, and discover some disturbing thoughts that they never would have encountered beyond picking up that book. They would never of learned such things. Reading information like this, creates a move advanced society. Adults and children are becoming smarter each day. Any parent would agree that they would love any opprotunity to arise for their children to become smarter and more wiser than they already were. Songs, movies, books, and magazines could provide that for their child. Reading is an escape from a jungle of wild monkies for some children. They @MONTH1 use a book to get away from the struggles of everyday life and get lost within its lively pages. If more and more books are being censored and thrown out, that equates to less books a child could have an opprotunity to discover. I once read that even @CAPS4 classes all over the world are not allowing their students to read The @CAPS5 of @CAPS6 @CAPS7. The teachers find this book to be too inappropriate for their students. This is unfair for any student, because this novel is inspiring and life changing, so they are definitely missing out. Also, movies and songs are provided for one's pure entertainment, so @CAPS3 shouldn't always matter if its crude. A child or young adult @MONTH1 learn things that they never thought imaginable through provided public materials.     In conclusion, books, magaizines, movies, and music are one's individual way of expressing themself. They should not be censored because a human being should have a judgement of their own, parents have the right to exclude offensive material from a child's life, and material, not matter how crude @CAPS3 @MONTH1 be, can be used as a learning tool. If more and more material is being removed from our local libraries, @CAPS3's almost like authors are being punished for being unique. Our children won't be exposed to as much, therefore, they won't learn and grow from @CAPS3. Do you really want our society to prohibit intelectual thinking just because they think certain material @MONTH1 be offensive? Think about @CAPS3	5
3143	To start, if any materials in the library such as books, music, movies, or magazines are found offensive i believe that they should still remain on the shelves. This book or music @MONTH1 be offensive but everyone is intitled to their own opinon. People have all the freedom to read, listen or watch anything that is approperite to them. I believe it should all be up to the individual to chose what they should do with what @MONTH1 offend others.      Also from my own exprience i have read a book about @CAPS1 @CAPS2 in the stadges of our history where they were salves and were hung for their punishment. It @MONTH1 offend some that their local library having a book on such a terrible topic but it is found that it is part of history and others @MONTH1 find it interesting to go back a learn more information. It does not have to mean that they are rascist or trying to offend you they would just like to learn more about our history. Each person has had topics that offend them but the libraries can not make all happy. If you chose to pick a book, watch a movie, or listen to music that @MONTH1 offend someone then it shouldn't be removed, if you would like to read, watch or listen to anything that @MONTH1 offend someone then it should be up to you to decide what to do about it.        Therefore, i conclude that if any books, music, movies, or magazines are found offensive they should remain on the shelves. Everyone @MONTH1 have their own opinon or have their own ideals that offend them but it is our job to let those people choose their liking of anything open in our local libraries. It is for their own benifit, not for yours. It is up to you to decide wheather or not to come about the situation. Libraries should not be held responsable and have to removed anything open to the people that @MONTH1 just be part of our background	3
4683	Public libraries should be able to keep all sorts of content for all sorts of people.     I feel very strongly about my statement, because everyone in this world is different. Many people have different interests, religons, and customs. If we took out certain books, and music from the library, it would defeat the purpose of calling it the public library. But if we had different sections of books, music, etc., people would be able to find what they want/need more easily, and no one would have to worry about getting offended.      It would not be fair to anyone in this world if we took out certain books and materials because one person had got offended.	2
4090	I believe that if there are books, music, movies, or magazines that offends you. People shouldn't be able to disarm that material off of the shelf. If it's there children they're worried about just teach them from staying away from adult section. Also, some people don't like foul language but thats there opinion. Than we wouldn't have any material left in the library if everyone had the rights to disarm offensive material. 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any us' (Paterson).     If it's your children your worried about seeing censorship in libraries but, you don't mind it just have them stay in the kids section reading books. You could just go a day where you want to go by yourself so you don't have to worry about your kids spotting any censorship. Before checking the material out skim through it make sure there is nothing offensive for your child.      Many people don't like foul language but, that's there opinion. It doesn't bother me because it gives the book a little taste and it's more interesting. Helps you understand what the reader is feeling upon someone or thing. Sometimes it helps show what mood the reader has in the story.     Finally, if everyone had the right to disarm all the offensive materials, we wouldn't have anything left. This could effect peoples education and reading skills. Some of that material is peoples hobbies they wouldn't be able to do what they like anymore.     'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off of the shelf '(Paterson). It's an easy fix just teach your children from right and wrong. Would you rather have your children have a good education or not know how to read? Many people dislike foul language but it could make the book better. I don't know what I would do if there was no more books. Well these are examples of why people shouldn't have the rights to disarm material off of the shelf if it offends them. What would you do if you had something you loved taken away from you?	3
3608	Well do you think that every book you read, every movie you watch, and all music you listen to is offensive. Who can say what is offensive to everyone? Who can tell you what you think is offensive or not? How can you be your own person if people are making desisions for you about the books you read, the movies you watch, and the music you listen to? I'm going to tell you about why I think that no certain materials such as books, movie, music, magazines, ect., should be taken off library selves because someone finds them offensive.      Who can be the ultimate decision maker in deciding if something is offensive to everyone? Everyone has their own meaning of offensive. Everyone thinks that different things are offensive to them. How can you say that one thing is offensive to one person and is also offensive to another person?. I think if one person thinks that something is offensive to them that is ok, that is their own opioion, but maybe the next person that walks by and see's the so call offensive material will love it. You should not be able to make someone elses decisions for them if they want to read an offensive book, watch an offensive movie, and or listen to offensive music that is their chose not someone elses to make for them.       If every peson took a book off the selves that they thought to be offensive then we would not longer have any books on the selves. Some people think that certain music, books, and movies are offensive and other people think that the books, music, and movies are cool and interesting so what do you do then? I have learned over the years that not every person will agree with your opinions on everything and you won't agree with them but yet you both still have your own opinions. You both are allowed to decide what you do and dont like. You both get to choose what books you read, what movies you watch, and what music you listen to. So why should we let anyone stop us from being ourselves?     You can never say that anyone thing is offensive to everyone because no one person can be everyone. You can't talk for someone else because everyone has a voice for themselves. So do you think that every book you read, every movie you watch, and all the music you listen to is offensive? well you @MONTH1 not but someone else somewhere is trying to take that out of the libraries because they have a negative opinion about it but is that fair?	4
4585	Yes, some materials,such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., are offensive.Yet they shouldn't be removed from shelves.Reason number one is: @CAPS1 some people find offensive, others don't. Reason number two is:'offensive' material will @CAPS6 be out in the world.And finally, if parents don't want their children reading offensive material, they should only ban their children from reading them and not the rest of the world. In @CAPS2 following essay, I will explain thoroughly my reasons for an opinion as such.     '@CAPS1 is one man's trash is another man's treasure.' @CAPS2 quote goes very well with the first reason: @CAPS1 some people find offensive, others don't. People's views about everything could be significantly different. For example, a book about @PERSON1 killing the @CAPS3 could be offensive to someone with @CAPS4 descent, meanwhile,a book filled with cursing could be offensive to a religous person. As you can see,'offensive' is defined differently by different people.     Offensive material will @CAPS6 be out in the world. Parents can't shelter their child from these things forever. At one point in their lives, children will learn offensive things and parents won't be able to do anything about that. Children have actives mind that pick up on everything around them. If they learn from these offensive materials, then parents should teach them @CAPS1 is wrong and @CAPS1 is right.     Finally, if parents don't want their children reading offensive material, they should only ban their children from reading them and not the rest of the world. @CAPS2 reason ties in perfectly with the first. Parents can't decide @CAPS1 the parents of other children should do. They can only do something about @CAPS1 their children are doing.     Therefore, my belief on censorship in libraries is nonexistant for the following reasons. @NUM1.)@CAPS1 some people find offensive, others don't. @NUM2.)Offensive material will @CAPS6 be out in the world. And @NUM3.)If parents don't want their children reading offensive material,they should only ban their own children from reading them and not the rest of the world. Thus, there should be no censorship in libraries	3
4035	Readers of the @ORGANIZATION1,     Censorship in libraries should never be an issue. It is a very simple concept. Obviously, no one wants their children being exposed to inappropriate reading material or movies. If a child wishes to visit the public library, their parents shouldn't have to worry about what their children will be looking at there. A library should be a family-friendly place where children can get together for story time, or where college students can study. I remember going to the library all the time when I was younger. I would read a different story every week with a large group of kids in the community. It was something I enjoyed doing. Don't you want your community library to be a place where children can learn and enjoy themselves?     Unfortunately, some libraries do have offensive reading material, movies, music, etc. It is the responsibility of the library employees to put these offensive materials in the adult reading section of the building. Parents should tell their children that the adult section is off-limits, and the library employees should keep children from every being in that restricted area. These items @MONTH1 be offensive to some people, and they @MONTH1 be too inappropriate for children. However, there are some readers who have the right to look at these materials if they want. That's why they shouldn't be taken off of the shelves completely, just removed from the rest of the books, music, movies, etc.      I am not one to deny anyone their rights. Even though I don't personally see the need for offensive reading materials in a public library, that doesn't mean that someone else shouldn't get to view these items. All in all, we have to be fair. Would you want someone taking away your right to do something you like to do because they find it offensive? No, nobody wants that. However, we still have to be reasonable about it. If there are going to be adult reading materials in a community library, they have to be in an area where children aren't allowed. It's just common courtesy, and everyone has to cooperate. This is why censorship in libraries should never be an issue. I hope that you can see it my way, and help me in fixing this issue once and for all.                                             Sincerely,                                                  @LOCATION1	3
4749	When you think of a book do you think happy kids books, or mysterious dark books? What if I was to say offensive books? Most magazines, music, books, and movies you take off the shelf today are not so happy or mysterious that you @MONTH1 think.      When I think of a movie I want to watch I think of something that im going to injoy; not something im going to shut off in the middle of it. What if you pick a movie that @MONTH1 look good from the front cover and you read the back and it sounds good but when you get home to watch it with your little sister or brother its the exact opposite. Do you turn it in? Do you turn it off and waist your money not doing anything about it?     Offensive books, movie, music, and magazines should be cleared from the store. If your not going to finish it, then why is it there? Im not going to watch or read a book if its not going to make me feel good as a person or make myself feel good. If people can sit there and write it, act it or play it then we should be able to speak our oppinion on it if its good or not.      People have feelings, if there going be hurt by something we should enjoy then take them off the shelves. Do something about it. We all should have the success for doing something for other people, and if not that then for ourselves.	3
4023	In my experience some music is just too offensive.  They use words that should not be heard by certain people and especially certain ages. Even the magazines have things that are just way too inappropriate for some people.  Some of the movies they put out these days are just horrifying to see.  The fact that they put these things in a library shocks me greatly.     One day I was babysitting a little girl and I had taken her to the library.  There was a @CAPS1 on a shelf and she put it in her @CAPS1 player.  It  was making very sexual references and had many curse words in it.  I was mortified that the little girl had to hear those words at such a young age.  As soon as I put my ear to her head phones, I turned it off immediately. They should really watch @CAPS4 music they put put out to the public because if I hadn't of been with her, she might have picked up on some of those words.  I don't think @CAPS3 would want anyone listening to that kind of language at any age really. It disciminates woman and gives young children ideas in their heads of sexual activities.     One other thing they put out in libraries i don't agree with is magazines that are a little too mature.  I went to the library one day with a friend of mine and i picked up a @ORGANIZATION1 magazine.  I was flipping around and I saw all these revealing pictures and I was thinking to myself, '@CAPS4 if a yooung cjild picked up this magazine when no one was looking?' That would be a horrible experience for a young child to have.     I've read somewhere that things children see at a young age, have a great effect on who they will become.  If this is true I certainly thing we should censor @CAPS4 we out out in our public libraries and be careful if we take our children to the library.  We should make sure the next generation doesn't see certain things that we have.  We should also monitor the movies the watch and keep a close eye on the things they read	4
3842	Lets think in todays known world the childern and teens have access to pretty much everything.     If you ask a teenager this same question should this stuff be tooken off the shelves. They might say no. If ask an adult how ever they are most likely going to say yes. The music that surrond young adults and childern isn't the best. Go ahead and listen you will be amazed. If they have access to it then they are going to take it and borrow it.      I feel that most of the music and movies on shelves anywhere should be taken off. Now thats just my opinion. Even adults listen to this stuff and watch all of this stuff. I say that the reason why people are failing school is because of all this stuff. @CAPS1 you think about it they have so many rights that they shouldn't have.      If there is anything offensive then it should be tooken off the shelves. They should be replaced with educational things. Lets go back to where it all began back @CAPS1 everytbing started to come out. Did you have most of this stuff growing up? You probably didn't. But now you can find anything almost anywhere. Which is kind of sad if you ask me. Magazines however are starting to bcome more like movies and music. Mainly with all the nudity and foul words that they show.      If you look at atheltes it doesn't matter who it is they get in trouble for things they shouldn't of said. @CAPS1 they should be out teaching kids not to say this stuff. That right there will help out educatiion and what not. You can become a more responible adult by showing them whats right and whats wrong. Starting with what they listen to or what they watch. I'm not allowed to watch current things and yet I do anyway. Thats because my parents aren't giving me enough discipline and they didn't @CAPS1 I was little.      If you let a child grow up to listen and watch what they want the odds they might not do good in school. One way you can help out is by hanging out with the chiold or childern. Even teens. Even though the don't want you too. Talk to them make conversatuions teach them right from wrong, @CAPS1 you teach a child right from wrong the outlook on school will be better	3
3363	They need to remove the bookstors because all studeds wants that the library have many books like spanish books or the diffrent culture, and the students can knows diffrent languges or that they can do many this with that books.  Like example they can read load and also they can do the same book with others words.                                                                                      And also the music and movies they need to remove because     some dvds are spokeds thats they need to remove.      For example librarys in the world that the need to borrow somes books for many people took, and the people can takes the book without pay nothing, thats the people want that the librarys are free.  Also the librarys need to spants with many parts in the world that many people think that did's great idea because many people said no because the librarys can't not borrow a books or dvds,  magazines, etc.   Thats why the librarys need that the people know that the   librarys not borrows books thats happed in the world....  I think the librarys need to do is go with the people and show what they have in the library and borrow books dvds thats the people want too... sometimes the library can rent the dvds that are interesting that the people can't find in the other place, like movies new but if the library not have the dvds somes people can go to the library and give to the bookstor that you can find in the other place. would we have to read more like many people do thats great idea. And the library need more style for the people are excited and take the books and read.	2
3375	I think libraries shouldn't removed material from the shelves even thoug its offensive. The libraries should't removed offensive material because even though it might be offensive to some people other people still might want to learn about that topic. For an example the @CAPS1 didn't like the @CAPS2. In some books its has some offensive stuff about @CAPS2 that were stated by @CAPS4. Some @CAPS2 might take that offensive but other people from diffrent race or relegion might want to learn about what was said. Just because people read about it doesne't mean all of them are going to agree with it. People might have their own point of view, no one has there right of telling one person what they can or can't like.      If cenorship starts to occur in libraries or other in other communtiy places, I think people are going to get mad and might have a bigger problem than some people being offensded of their material. They might think that they are being told of what they can or can't read,listen,or believe in.That will occur a bigger conflict and get a lot of people furious. I think it will be simplier if library haves the materials on shelves and people who are getting offended of what they have in there should ignore it because why will they read or listen to something if it only gets them furious? They might be offended of what one person says but who cares, not everyone is going to think or agree of what is being said. Its just a person point of view let them be them and just stick with what you think of yourselves  and in your believes. Not everyone is right and perfect just be youselves	3
3989	People of the world @MONTH1 always find something they think is offensive that others don't. In this case I think that if it is in a public library they do need to watch what they put on the shelves. If some little kid grabs a playboy from the youngster's section, the library is probably going to get sued. Libraries are supposed to be a place where people can get a book to read or to look up some information about any school-work they have. Books about anatomy are an exeption but if that library has a book like sex for dummies then something needs to @CAPS1 in that facility.     Movies too, if somebody wants that kind of material they need to go else where to find it. Exposing those kinds of movie clips and images could be harmful to the children of future @LOCATION1. If our world crashes as we know it because kids couldn't find the correct information needed, then that shows that we deserved it.    What kind of movies we watch, advertisement we pay attention to, what music we listen to most, and many other things are what make people who they truly are. People these days read magazines that can be completely harmless but come with an ad. that says @CAPS2 @CAPS3, or All @CAPS4 @CAPS5, these are found in a lot of magazines like @CAPS6 @CAPS7 and sometimes @CAPS8. These ads. are totaly uncalled for.     If people looked into this more, than they do we wouldn't have to fight this as much.     These things that people find to be offensive are harsh and cruel things to show our young readers, writers, and musicians. These type of things influence kids to do this type of stuff that americans and non-americans find so offensive. So libraries be aware of what you put on your shelves and be aware of the consequences.	4
3548	Do I believe that vertain materials should be removed from the shelves of libraries if found offensive? I believe that all types of materials should be placed in libraries to satisfy the different styles of what people like. Censorship should not play a role because everyone has their own opinions on what is looked at as offensive and what is not. By giving everyone the freedom to enjoy what they like will make alot of people happier.      The wants and needs of people varie from one extreme to the other. What one person loves, another @MONTH1 hate. This should not play a role in whether or not materials should be removed from public places such as a library. Everyone has the right to express themselves through art in their own way. Taking away the art that some find offensive would not be fair to those who enjoy it. By doing this, not all people will be satisfied when not everyone gets what they want.     Censorship should not take part in any library. Entertainment can not always please everyone. It will be judged in many ways no matter what anyone has to say, so the problem should just be left alone. Arguing to take away the material that some like will only cause tension to rise and make matters worse. It is understandable, for example, that a parent would not want their child to be able to be welcomed into the media world where not everything has postive influences. That's life though and not everyone has th same outlook on it. You have to think of others, and respect their view of it all as well.     Opinons will vary with what I have had to say. I strongly believe that people should be given the right to enjoy the materials they take an interest in. Censorship definitely has its positives and negatives, but for the most part it is wrong and should not have a role in any library. Cutting down people's availability to their interests will only lead to frustration. You can not please everyone, so in that case, censorship will just have to be looked beyond.	3
4116	What should and should'nt be censored in a library really is just a matter of opinion from the people using the library. If everyone were to removed what they didnt like from the shelves of a library then much information would be less acceceble to the general public. Although some people @MONTH1 be offended by some forms of literature, this doesnt mean that the literature should be removed from everyone. I beleive a solution must be made to satisfy everyone.     Currently, some people arent happy with some of the books, music, movies, and magazines that are available at many libraries. They believe that the information @MONTH1 be unsuitable for some veiwers. Some people just do not want certain information getting in the minds of children.     While that is a very solid reason to censor what goes into our libraries; there are others who dissagree with the thought of censoring our libraries. By allowing the censoring of libraries it would decrease the amount of information available to the public. If parents allow their children to take out certain materials without first checking whats behind the cover, then the parents have noone to blame but themselves.     I believe that this could all be resovled by simply having parents fill out a form before allowing their children to get a library card. This form would include a list of things that they would want to prevent their kids from checking out such as: swearing in books and music, nudity in movies and magazines. This information would be put with the cerial number of the library card. If their child were to checkout something that is restricted on the list, the librarian would tell them to put the book back and pick another book.     I can see how censorship is very useful and important. Although sometimes it can be takin a bit to the extreme. There is a solution out there, but we just need to find it.	4
3302	I believe as a citizen of this city and as a avid library goer, that censorship in libraries is neccessary. Some of the material in the libraries @DATE1 are very graphic and sometimes quite a bit offensive. Do we really want our children looking at half-nude people or the murder of innocent people just because of their skin color?     In @DATE1's libraries there are many books and movies that represent racism. Take for instance the movie '@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @PERSON1.' In the movie the white children get yelled at because they are playing with the @CAPS3-@CAPS4 children. This is a wonderful example of why censorship is neccessary. Just think, if your child were to watch this and then go and say something rude to one of their friends, who is @CAPS3-@CAPS4, it would be very offensive to them. Although this movie is about historical events, it still needs to be taken off the shelves, in @CAPS1 opinion.     In @DATE1's society, nudity is becoming a big issue in movies and also in books. You @MONTH1 think that it is okay to let  your child watch a movie rated @NUM1, but little did you know, there is nudity in it. Depending on how old your child is, and if you let them on the computer or not, they might think it is okay to go and look up nude pictures on the internet.      Also, in books this is becoming an issue. It was just the other day I sat down to read a book about a musical that I wish to see, and there were nude pictures in it. Once I found this out, I asked @CAPS1 mother to please take it back. These are the sort of things that need to be taken off the shelves of our libraries.     Language usage in music is also a big deal. Many rap artists think it is okay to use offensive and explicit language in their music. I do not think they take into consideration that young children will be listening to their music. This genre of music needs to be taken off the shelves. You @MONTH1 think it is okay for your young child to listen to it now, but just wait until those words make it into their vocabulary.     I think that library censorship is a big deal that needs to be taken into deep consideration. It @MONTH1 be different at first, especially when you go in to get your favorite rap tape, or your favorite @NUM1 movie, but trust me in the long run, you will thank the library for taking it off the shelves. Especially when you get older and have children. You will not want them listening, reading, or watching the things you watched as a child	4
4292	There should be a certain age bookshelf that only certain aged people are aloud to look at. It's like the adult section at the library. Theres no reason why they should be removed off of the shelves. I would understand if the little kids could come see the books and movies and be offended by it or scared but thats why you would make a certain section just for older more mature people.     It would just depend on what offends people and what would make them offended. Some things could or would be bad to have little kids see them, but just make sure they couldnt get in the reach of young kids or not matured people. The only way i would say remove them if it was really offensive such as racism and things like that.     Censorship in libraries in my opinion is a good thing. Just because the fact of some people might not like the things that would be in a library or things that they have in the library. So I would have to say yes on cersorship in the library.	3
3365	Censorship in Libraries     I know as well as everyone else does, that you can find almost anything, reading related, in the library. There is all different kinds of stuff in there. From children's books, to love stories and people's magazines, newspapers, movies, and music. Everyone is welcome in the library, of course, but is everyone aloud to look at whatever they want?     I personally think it's a good idea to have all of this stuff in the library, for anyone, even though some of it's not very appropriate. For people who sit at home and don't have a library, maybe they want to know about something specific and the first place they would think about going is the library. Nobody can really help with what people @MONTH1 find in the library but i think it's a good idea to keep that kind of stuff in a public place. You could go on the internet to get whatever information you need, yeah, but, what if the internet doen't have what you're looking for? I like books better then internet myself. Anybody can put information on the computer, but atleast when it's in a book, it's true, because it has to be published and read by someone that wouldn't let a book with false information be sent out to the public.     If the libraians are worried about underaged kids getting into books that they're not suppose to, then put it somewhere where they can't reach. Put the adult books in the adult section, and don't let the little kids go in that area. You could always put them up high too so the kids wouldn't even know they was there. All the libraries I've ever been to, had their own sections, the adults would go to their section, and the kids would go to their's. If the parents are afraid of what their kids will find, then keep them home and don't let them go to the library. Make your own at home, then you could put whatever books and magazines you want in there	3
3694	I believe that certain materials such as books, music, movies etc. should not be removed if they are found offensive. The library has different sections for different groups like the yound @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 section, easy children or picture and @CAPS1.      Young @CAPS1 or the @CAPS2 section is for mainly the teens. They have books that a teen who normally read. The @CAPS2 section has music which teens listen to. For @CAPS4 they have the twlight soundtrack. This section does not have any explicit language.The teens who go into the library actually enjoy the select of books offered to them.It has everything most teens like to read about. There is nothing offensive in this section and it should not be removed.     There is also a childrens section called the easy or picture book section. This section are for the younger children. Children that are not in school or in the early stages of school. The books, music an movies in this section are cartoons an animals. Things that children would like to read, listen or watch about. For @CAPS4 this section has movies like strawberry shortcake, athur, even lilo and stitch. eveything in this section is made for children there is not one thing in this section where the child or parent who think is offensive.     The library has a section for adults. The @CAPS1 section is there to catch adults eye. It a separate fom the @CAPS2 and Children sections. It is located at the other end of the library. If there is an @CAPS1 who thinks that something is offensive they have the right to talk to someone who works at the library. Most adults do not have a problem with the items in thier section. The library keeps the adults section with things that adults would want to look for. It would not have something little children would want.      The entire library is split up into different sections. It is easy for the children to look at books for them and for adults to do the same. There are only a few that I named but every age group has a specific spot at the library. If there is something found offensive to the people I dont think it should be removed because it might just be in the wrong section. The library takes great precaution to the censorship of their books, movies music etc	3
4570	Taking books off the shelves will not change anything children are just goin to @CAPS1 to a different place to find the book, @CAPS1 to a book store or Other librabies if they like it. If I seen a book and I knew I wasnt suppose to read but then I knew it was  good music, book, or magazie. I would get it cause thats what children do explore. books are here to read and to look at i feel if you know im not suppose to read it make me show prof of age or not give it to me.          Really dont understand why sum books be in stores and people dont want u reading them. Sum children dont read at all and to see them to pick up a book, @CAPS2 down to read should be good eoungh. But there is always a age group thats not suppose to read some books. But at the smae time you cant keep the child away from the world, and what it brings you. The book are put there for a reason and not just to be walked past.          I feel like the reason why children listen to music is that some time the track relate to them in a way that a other person would not understand. So they feel the song other thren what another person would hear just the @CAPS3, @CAPS4, @CAPS5, and @CAPS6. Thats not what sum parents want you to hear.     Magazines tells alot of things and show to much for the younger minds. Im a father my self and would want my son at the age of @NUM1 looking at any naked girl or adds about pron in @ORGANIZATION1 books or any of that kind. parents can sometimes be over hard on a child and not let them do a lot of things. But they feel that they knows whats best for u. What ever  they tell you is not wrong cause the @MONTH1 have been through it already. That would only lead to them doing things behide there backs. But if they want learn the easy way its aways the hard way.	2
3178	We all enjoy having the freedom to read, listen, and watch what we like. How would you feel if that freedom was taken away from you?  Some people believe that censored books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from libraries. I believe you should have the right to read, listen, and watch whatever you choose, but children should talk to their parents about it first if it is a censored material.      We all know that not everything is okay for certain age groups to read, see, or listen to. That does not mean that the item should be removed completely though. Instead, the child should talk to a parent about the censored item. The parent can decide if the child is mature enough for the item. Also, if those materials are removed from libraries completely, someone that is mature enough to be reading, listening, or seeing it will not have a chance to.      I remember when I was in middle school, I really wanted to read @PERSON1 novels that I saw at the library. My mother believed that I should not read those novels at that age. My mother and I worked out a compromise that I could read @PERSON1 novels that she approved of. She said when I was older, I could read any of @PERSON1's novels that I wanted. I found this compromise to be very fair. I knew that when I was old enough to read those novels, they would still be there on the shelf waiting for me.     We should have the right to read, listen, and watch what we enjoy, but younger children or other age groups should be monitored. That does not mean we need to completely remove those materials from libraries though. When those children are old enough to read, watch, or listen to those materials, they should be able to go to the library, knowing it will be there on the shelf waiting for them.	4
3153	Everyone has a right to read, listen, or watch what they want. Sometimes it's not always up to them. For example rated-@CAPS1 movies, most children under @NUM1 cannot watch them. Either its a law or the parents have made it a rule. Music I think is different. Some songs have a bad influence on children whether it has to do with violence or cussing, certain songs like that still give kids the wrong message. Libraries should not have those kind of books, music, movies, magazines, etc. If people want to view those kind of things that other people find 'offensive' they should buy them on their own time. Not everyone has a great sense of humor so things that some people @MONTH1 find funny other people get offended by. Even if libraries had anything that would offened someone else, it would be the readers choice to pick a book they want to read.      Sometimes it @MONTH1 be better off if the children read these articles by themselves so it'd save time from having parents explain it to them later. They might ask a lot of questions the parents might not even have the answer for. For example, when my brother watched a rated-@CAPS1 movie. In my brother's younger years he was always curious and asked a lot of questions all the time. Sometimes my mother didn't know how to respond so she'd change the subject. Well, everyone knows the same old question '@CAPS3 do babies come from?'. That's the kind of question my brother was curious about. My mom never bothered to answer that question, but if she did she would make up some story. My brother was smart enough to know that what he was being told wasnt accurate at all. Finally one day he got nosy and took one of my mom's movies without asking. It happen to have the answer to his question. He was shocked and disgusted at the same time yet he was glad to know he finally found the answer my mom wouldnt give.     In this situation I am somewhat nuetral. I dont object to having things that might offened other people be removed from book shelves but on the other hand it might not be a good thing to put 'offensive' things and certain libraries @CAPS3 children can get to them. Perhaps it's what makes things not boring and makes it more interesting to the reader. Not everyone has the same opinion on things. It just @MONTH1 be a good thing to have these types of books whether its stating a fact or stating their own opinion. Everyone does have a right to say their opinion and there is nothing wrong with giving informational facts in articles or movies either.     The bad thing about having any 'offensive' things in libraries @MONTH1 not be a smart idea if it's @CAPS3 most children get there books. Parentscan always have a say in what kind of book their children read or what kind of movies they watch. Some parents might not want to go through all the questions the children ask and give something to them that will explain it better for there understanding, while other parents dont want their children  to see or know of any sort of things that @MONTH1 be 'offensive' until their old enough to understand it better and are mature about those things. So in some cases it might be bad idea for things that only an adult should know be on book shelves in a library @CAPS3 a child might get ahold of it.     The quotation ' All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if i have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' by Katherine Paterson has its own opinion. The quotation is basically  saying if even a parent doesnt want their child to read something 'offensive' if that parent reads it that sometime their children have a right to know. If the child has tooken anything like that off a shelf that once they know they will not ask anymore questions.	4
3921	There are many different styles of  literature and media in this world.  With this variety, it has to please at least one person. If not, why was it made? There come a point when things just become too much. Some media and literature has passed this point and it should not be allowed on shelves.       Media is a huge influence in todays society.  What would you do without it?  Everyday, everyone is using media related, whether it is turning on the televison in the moring and watching the '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' to opening up a magazine and reading about what famous person is in jail this time.  You cannot get away from it. Teens @CAPS1 are truely addicted for the most part. We have video games, online chats (facebook and myspace), and moives.  Many things we learn from these are not good for our minds and health.   Some video games are good to play but when you become wrapped up in them, playing non stop, killing people and laughing at this, here you know there is something wrong.  Our minds are exposed to so much immorality and violence, so we think it is okay to do. Many people see it as, the movie stars do it, so why can't we?  @CAPS1's society is killing our minds and many young people who think their life is miserable just go out and commit suicide.       Music can get too extensive as well.  Yes, you have you oldies, country, and the jazz but when you add in the rap and heavy metal music, there is no understanding. Rap is all about who am I going to sleep with next and how many times I can have sex. Really, is this what our lives should be focused on? I didnt know people like the thought of a @CAPS3.  Heavy metal music, you cannot understand it, but when you research the words you see that life is useless and why are we living?  People say that this music helps them calm their anger down. Feeling realived after they have listen to it. You @MONTH1 be clam now but after hearing these words and banging your head around, what is going to happen when you do get extrememly mad?        Too many lives are effect by @CAPS1's media and literature. Lives of friends have been lost and friendships have been ruined.  Someone is always going to say a certain amount is too much, but I think we need to set a goal of how much is too much and try to save ourselves.  We are not like a video game that has seconds lives	3
3832	'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if i have the right to remove that book from the shelf--that work i abhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Katherine Paterson said this about the topic of book censory in the library. This is a very tricky subject because no one will ever be happy. All books, music, movies, magiznes, etc.can be considered offensive to someone.      When it comes to books in the library we should have sections. One for @CAPS3, child, family, activity, romance, etc. if we have thoes then it would cut down on what books children can look at. One time I went to @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 and I accidently wondered into the @CAPS3 books section. I knew that I was not suppost to go into that section, but if they had it marked that it was the @CAPS3 Books section then I would not have gone in there.     Parents need to moniter what there kids look at, or even what part of the library they go into. If a child wonders into the romance section then they are going to see that kind of book it is not the librarys fault or even the fault of the writer. If the parent does not want to moniter what the child looks at they could set boundries. they could say 'Do not leave this section.'. If my mom said that to me i would stay around the child books. The parents could moniter the child to solve the problem.     Library's need to decide what kind of books they are going to have in the library. If the library does not have the kind of books you do not want your child to see then your child can not look at that book. If your public library does keep thoes books in the open the parents could always go to a town hall and tell the mayor, librarian, or other towns people about the rude books. If you tell people the library has that kind of books then others will stand up aginst the books.     If you do not like what the library has on the shelfs, suggest sections for the books, keep watch of what your kids look at, or tell someone that can do something about the problem. What are you going to do to improve you public library? how are you going to make you kids not go and look at the books you dont want them to see	4
3996	Empty @CAPS1     @CAPS2 is it wrong to censor? In the world there are today there is about @NUM1 billion people. All these people make up diffrent groups with diffrent moral codes, ethics, beliefs, and out looks on the world. With this in mind, there comes a problem with what is wrong and right. The three subject that will be discused in this article will be censorship, expression, and society.     To be censored puts a lable on things that says this article is not fit to be seen, or heard by anyone. Censorship was made to protect people from raw material that is seen as unfit or cruel. Music is censored for the subject or matter it speaks about, wether it would be of sex, drugs, or poltics. This goes for movies, magazines, newspapers, televison, or other forms of media. the reasons that somethig is censored changes from place to place.     Expression of ones inner thoughts of the world or a genral area could be desaterous in the eyes of some. To others, expression gives the chance to see who could be the next @CAPS3 vinci, @PERSON1, or anyother great thinker of the world. Censoring these people can and would be horrible. The idea that just beacuase someone has a diffrent out look does not mean they are the evil that is in the world. True their work could cause a problem, but their idea should not be shuned by the world. The material they produce should be aloud to be seen by anyone of any age.     Society possess a big problem. Society or how one should act in public is diffrent all over the world. So therfore what is censored here would not be censored somewhere else. This also mean what is wrong or right is diffrent to everyone on earth. The society will have great effect on with is aloud to be seen or heard by those that live in the society. if the society disagrees with the ideas of something the society will have it banned. If this is let to continue nothing will be aloud to speak its mind on anything.     So @CAPS2 is censorship wrong? Censorship is unjust to those with ideas unlike others. If someone can censor someone else then that person that is being censored could in turn censor the person that is censoring them because of that persons veiws. So yes it is wrong to censor anything or anyone for thier ideas, morals, ethics, rules, laws, beliefs, or conduct. Everything should be aloud to exsist and be seen or heard by anyone who wants to look into that subject of matter. In conclusion censorship, expression, and society will always have veiws but none of these view should ever be hiddin from anything or anyone.	4
4530	I think that this kaind of books they maybe sometimes offend to some people that depending of what kaind or type of book, magazine, movie, music don't want to see there and agree and not agree on this because they are some some type of thinks that are not bad for kids like games for they age or music that are appropiate for there age and others like animals, cultures and all that thinks but that only think that I am not agree is that they can not be books, music, magazines, or even movies that have sexual arrasment that type of stuff not go into a library I think that that type of stuff can be dangueres or affencive for some parents and people that have or don't have kids and I think if they are in some libraries that I agree that they need to take that off because I don't want or people want that kids be disrespecfull and learn that type of thinks that they don't go with there educasion and with there age. I desagree too that this type of music that some artist are meading that they are tooking about drugs, gongs and narcotrafic and even sex and I know this because sometimes I heer this on the @CAPS1 and radio that they are sining and this influence to kids to have another directions on their life and us like parents we don't want that for our kids, don't want that fro their future, we want that they have a good future and be succefull and give them the same example to their kids to went they wrog up and  be a parent to and they are going to see what we are tooking about.I been seen it and parts of the world people been kill or people killing at other inocent persons for this type of things more for drugs that they are saling drugs and they are doing money that they are hurting to other people or kids that consume this drugs that maybe can be our kids or some friends kid and sometimes if they don't pay that money that they need to pay they kill them or that police are traying to faind them because are doing bad thinks and I hope that artist, or people that put this on the libraries think firts that maybe they are doing something wrong of steff that are thinking that are doing something good	3
3507	How can writing be offensive? Many @CAPS1 find swear words in writing or violence to be very offensive. Yet others find that those things make their writing more interesting. Writing can cover all aspects of life and give us ideas like racism and other inappropriate thoughts. It seems like in today's writing you can pick up just about anything and somone will find it offensive. That means if we censored our libraries to the extreme there would be no books left. It is just like Katherine Paterson says in the quote, '...then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'     @CAPS1 can't deny that books and any other writing place ideas in our head. That idea is a seed and we can either choose to water that seed and let it grow or cause it to die out. I believe we have a choice to either except or deny those offensive ideas in our head. If we find something offensive, simply set the book down and use that better judgemnt. We know what is right therefore we decide what is ok to read. Everyone sees things differently.     What about children, can we trust their better judgement? I fear that children don't have as great of judgement as more mature adults. The resposibility of judgement lies more on the parents of that child than the libraries. The libraries place books for kids in a certain section to make sure they find appropriate books for their age. Both the adults and children get to find books that fit them and don't offend them.      If libraries did do censorchip it would deny us our rights and freedom to speek our minds clearly without a haze being placed to confuse it. We as a country were built off the radical and offensive things written about the @CAPS2. Those words are what fired us up to become an independent country. Just think if they would have censored those ideas. Would we still be @LOCATION1 today? What it all comes down to is not that we should censore our reading but that we should use our better judgement.	4
4695	Have you ever went to the library and while looking for a book you come across a book about slavery with strong language or teenage years which included alcohol, drugs, and sexual content?  In the library, you can find books for leisure, study, training, and books found offensive to a variety of people.  People from children whose parents would be appalled by what their kids are reading about to adults find books offensive.  Although there is things in the library that are found offensive, I believe that books, movies, magazines, and music with offensive things in them should stay on the shelves because the internet is no different then the offensive things in a library, most people don't mind the vulgar and violence within the pages, and there are some fantastic books that some might find offensive.     People for centuries have been writing and coming up with songs, movies, and magazines.  What was accepted 'back then' is now considered inappropriate for viewers and readers.  There are many things in a library that, if not careful, could corrupt your children.  Children reading about violence, drugs, and other no no's are what teaches them wrong.  Parents and other people have been concerned about the censorship of libraries.  Hard enough as it is, parenting doesn't need the help of books, movies, and music to influence the bad onto children.  Children are the future and they need to be taught the right way.     An old librarian once told me that books need to be cherished throughout the years because they will eventually be replaced with technology and all the books, good or bad, will be gone.  It's hard to even imagine how technology is replacing various things in our lives and how it has changed from when it first started to be popular.  How does this pertain to offensive books?  Like almost everything out there, the internet could be used for good, or for harm.  Parents are concerned about their children reading books that are bad but let their child surf the internet which is hard telling how many inappropriate sites he/she might go to accidentally, or on purpose.  Books, music, and other offensive stuff in libraries are minor compared to the internet.  Protecting children from adult content filled libraries should be the least of a parents concerns.  Even if they are concerned about the minds of their children when they go inside a library, they can filter what a child looks at and reads about.  The internet is the real bad guy if anything is going to be blamed for corruption of minds.     Many people throughout the world have different tastes of what they like in a book.  A good plotline, good dialogue, interesting theme, drama, language, violence, drugs, alcohol, and sex are all ways people find reading books enjoyable.  Their own opinion on what is interesting is what helps them decide on books to read.  Reading books is a passion to some and enjoyable books is a must for them.  Without offensive books, people would find reading boring, and wouldn't be as popular as it has been.  I don't know about you, but I enjoy books that aren't boring.  Most offensive books are not boring and the action is what gets my attention and keeps me reading.     There are great books that for years people have enjoyed reading and continue to read today.  Even thought they are offensive, they provide good details that are required for a good book.  Tom @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 are famous for writing ghory, violent, grusome books that would be qualified as offensive to others.  You have the choice not to read them or to read them.  Books that deal with slavery @MONTH1 also be found offensive like the book @CAPS1.  It does a supurb job at describing how things were during slave times.     Books, music, magazines and music should not be removed from the book shelves because they are essensial to everyday people and reading. They are required by some to enjoy a good book.	4
