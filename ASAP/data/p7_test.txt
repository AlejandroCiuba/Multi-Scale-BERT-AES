18653	One hot @DATE1 day my family and I went to @ORGANIZATION1. There was a new ride open called shoot the rapids. It was a brown tall water ride with a tunnel and two hills. As we walked over to see how long the wait was it said @NUM1 hour wait. We all really wanted to go on it so we decided to wait. When we got in the line it was about @NUM2 outside, we were all sweating. And to make things worse there was this annoying little boy talking to me about some food or something. It was really annoying. We were about half way threw the line when my nerves kicked in I was really scared but I knew I had to be brave and suck it up. About @NUM3. Later we were @NUM4 people away from the ride. My heart was pounding, my knees were shaking. I thought I was going to die. Then all of a sudden it broke down. We had to wait another @NUM5. As time past we finally got on the water ride. I regret it. I screamed and cried but Im glad.  I didnt chicken out. That was a time I had patience and regret it.	23
18790	Patience is when you get in a long line at the grocery store when you are waiting for a new video game. That happened to me when I was on the great jorney to california. I had to stand in six very long line for up to @NUM1 hours it took forever to get on the plain when we finaly got there we were hungry so we had to wait inline for @NUM2 minutes when we were finally up to get our food we were starving we ate and went to a friends house we stayed  for an hour it started to get bouring but I had  patience and  waited  turns out it was not so bad after all. Being patient is an important thing in life wether you are or arnt patient is up to you that week was all about patients and lines lots of both it was a long day. Sadly we had to leave after that day which equals. Yap you guessed it for patience first was had to go huston, texas then @ORGANIZATION1  then we had to drive  @NUM3 hours to get home when we got home we were so tired  and passed the story to my friends and family.	16
19557	"Awhile back my friends and I made a @CAPS2 game called ""@CAPS1 n go @CAPS2"". I had just taken a great sniping position. I had a great angle in all but one direction. The great thing about this spot was that everyone walked past it to get around in the woods, @CAPS3 usually it didn't require any patience. That's the part I was wrong about. I ended up waiting over twenty minutes until I saw one of the people that were playing. I aim my weapon and fired, @CAPS4 to the rules he was now on my team and under my command. We waited for a while before another player was seen walking close to us. Then my partner got up to fire his weapon at the other player and got shot. He didn't notice me when I crawled away from him, @CAPS3 I was safe. The only problem now was that I needed a new place to @CAPS1 @CAPS6 I found one quick. Again I was waiting for over twenty minutes. Finally I saw another player and got ready to shoot. When I finally got my weapon from the ground the person was gone. This made me pretty made seens how I waited @CAPS3 long and didn't have a single person on my team. I got up and went looking for someone for my team. I was looking my patience and getting frustrated. ""@CAPS7 anyone even out here?"" I whispered ""@CAPS8! I got you @CAPS9!"" someone shouted from above. Then @PERSON1 jumped down from a tree. He told me that the whole time he was watching me. He   was waiting for me to get close enough to shoot. This whole time he was waiting with just enough patience to shoot every single person one by one."	24
18298	When my family went to makiew  we had to wait to get on the boat. We were patient because we had to wait toget on the  boat. We had to wait at least @NUM1 minutes for the boat. He did not start bering an abnacious @NUM1 year old @CAPS1 he just waited  in line. When we got there we rode around the island on a bike. The we did what he wanted to do.While we did that  I was patient. @CAPS1 I think  that the trip want pretty  good, because everybody was patient.	16
18160	One time I was patient. It was dec @NUM1 @DATE1 @CAPS1 eve. I was so excited that @CAPS1. On @CAPS1 eve morning I slept till @NUM2 I wanted to?? To come. I was patient so I played video games not thinking about @CAPS1. When I went to the store I seen all the @CAPS1 things. I felt like I couldt wait no longer. That night after dinner I found that I wanted to stay instead of going to sleep early to make @CAPS1 come faster. A little part of me wanted to go to sleep but I also wanted to stay up. I made some more food and went to sleep. When morning came I was so happy I ran into the living room. Sure enough there was the presents. My mom and dad were still sleeping. I decided to watch some to @NUM3 came and I wanted to open them so??? I knew it wouldt be right so I went to sleep??? At noon I woke up and ran to the living room. My mom and dad and my brother were there, I opened my presents like a lion feasting on a gazelle, I was so happy I waited.	23
19406	My moms in the hospital! My mom was in the hospital! She was getting a life-threting surgery. This is a story of a time I was of a time I was patient. My mom didnt feel good for two years. And when she whent to the doctors for a cheak-up it turned out she had heart disease @NUM1 main artary block ages. So I had to wait while she was getting  preped. It took two hours which felt like forever! Then I got to see her for five minutes then she had to be taken to the surgery room. The surgery took five hours. I sat in the waiting room after school. I did my homework and read magizens. I was very worried about my mom. But then the doctor comes in and says no one can see her for a whole day! I had to be patient and wait till the next day. That was the time I had patients and it payed off.	23
18474	A  time that i was patient was when i had to train my dog. sit boy, I command to my puppy. My dog instead of sitting runs at me jump and grabs the treat out of my hand. I go and try to grab the treat back from him and he gulps it down. While @CAPS1 walking  to grab his collar and take him for a walk he bolts away. After chasing him for hours he finally stops and looks at me waiting  to run again. @CAPS2 here Im done chasing you lets just go for a walk, please, I say as i slowly loose my patience. I begin to walk toward him again very slowly. I get close enough to grab his collar, but then the dog bolts again just leaving a bunch of dust behind. @CAPS1 done ! I scream and walk away with anger. I begin to leave and go up the hill to my house. I go to my room ready to sleep. The next morning @CAPS4 up and go outside to try and train dog.  I lost my patience yesterday and stormed off but today @CAPS1 ready to work hard and keep my patience. @CAPS6! I yell waiting  for my dog to @CAPS2 running and he does.With my first command i tell the dog to sit and he does not so I dont give him the treat. I say it again and he sits! Finally some progress after that waiting. I give him the treat and he starts waging his tail. To see if he understood i say it again. He sat again and got another treat. After that work with my dog I begin to  ask him to do more things,sometimes he doesnt listen and some times he does. That was a  time when I was patient with my dog to teach and train him and it definently paid off.	22
18138	"A time when I was patient. Two weeks ago @CAPS4 @CAPS2 said her @CAPS1 was coming. @CAPS4 grandma was happy so she bought her sister a bus ticket. Bus tickets cost a lot of money. It is @NUM1 dollar. That was a lot of money. She @CAPS11't miss this bus because I really want to see her. I could not wait. So she was suppose to be coming on @DATE1. She didn't come. I was sick so I called @CAPS4 @CAPS2 at her job. I said, ""@CAPS2 why didn't @CAPS3 come."" @CAPS4 @CAPS2 said,"" @CAPS5 she is coming you just have to be patient."" @CAPS6, I said. Next day was @DATE2. ""@CAPS2 is she here yet"" I said. ""@CAPS8, @CAPS5 be patient she will be here tomorrow."" ""@CAPS6, I understand.""I gave up I thought that she was not coming. So @CAPS4 mom called @CAPS4 godmom. She said it was @CAPS6. So she told me she was going to @ORGANIZATION1. I love @ORGANIZATION1. I so good. I asked @CAPS4 @CAPS2. ""@CAPS11 I have a @CAPS12. @ORGANIZATION2 cheese burger. I said @CAPS13 to @CAPS4 uncle and @CAPS4 mom said she was not coming. I told @CAPS4 mom I was not giving up she was coming. So I said I am hanging up. So I air hustled. @CAPS4 mom said to @CAPS4 uncle @CAPS14 ""should I get her something to eat. I thought she ment @CAPS4 grandmother. So I thought for a while her who is her. So I called back @CAPS4 mom said ohh I get food for uncle @CAPS14 dog. I said, @PERSON1's?  For a dog? She said know dog food. So @CAPS4 mom got me from @CAPS4 god mothers house I could not walk because @CAPS4 legs, back, arm and every part that I @CAPS11 move on @CAPS4 body hurt. So @CAPS4 grandmother came to her house because we have a keys. So she said where @CAPS16? @CAPS4 uncle whispered something and I said she here! Ran in @CAPS4 uncle room and hug her I said how are you because when I went for @CAPS4 grandmother birthday. She live in south caroline so yeah. The is @CAPS4 writing. That is when I was patient. So I could wait for @CAPS4 mom's @CAPS1."	12
18307	A  time   when   I  was  patient  was when  I  went  to  the  doctors. When  I  went  to  the  doctors  for  a  checkup, my  appointment  was  at  @TIME1 and  we  didnt  get  called  till @NUM1.  I had to wait a long time! Finally  when  we  got into the  doctors room  the  nurse  did my blood pressure and then  I  had  to  wait  another  @NUM2 mins  for  the  actuall  doctor. By the time the doctor   actually came it was about @NUM3.  I  got  my  flue  shot  and  the  swine  flue  shot.  When  I  was  all done  it  was  @NUM4  I was  ready  to  go  home.  Thats  a  time  when  I  was  patient.	19
18513	I chose write a story about a time when I was patient. It was my first time hunting, I was only hunting squirls but still. What I had to was walk in the woods and sit down once you sit down you cant move. So I was sitting very still for @NUM1 minutes and finally I seen a squirl. So I took my shotgun and shot her in the chest. I was patient so I got a squirl. So thats my story on patients.	17
18327	I am writing a story about a time that I was patient. One day on my birthday @DATE1 I was over my dads house. My dad asked me were do I want to go for my birthday. I didnt know at first but it came to my head. I told him I wanted to go paint hall shooting. And he said ok. But before we go he said can you cut the grass for me. I said ok. So I cut the grass which took me about @NUM1 hour and @NUM2 minutes so I told him Im done and he said ok, so I took a shower because I smelt like wet grass. And when I got done takns my shower I called my friends and cousins to see if they would to come and they said sure. So I asked my dad when are we going to leave to go pointball shooting. He told me it is going to be at a different day. So I called all of my friends and cousins back to tell them it wasnt going to be today. They were ok with it. And my dad said we were going to go before @DATE2 stars and we have went. And now until this day I am still being patient.	17
18151	Patience to me is a personal thought that turns into action. Ive been patience many times before. I use to go to the store at the corner of my block. I had to stand in a long line that actually went to the halfway point of my block. I went in got my stuff and went to the end of the line. A half hour past and it was five minutes til closing time. I get to the window and pay for my things @NUM1 minute before closing time. I was actually standing in line doing nothing. The owner of the store let me get a total of @NUM2 things for free. I got half of the stuff I wanted and the other half was house hold things. So being patient really pays off and can unlock many different treasures. So start running with patience and leaving impatience behind.	16
18587	"Aooooh   when am seven I wer  going to be able to  ride on the hoder  hunt; this able is hinting for ever said alex  mictiory advernter wea a fun place  ??? the ??? this routen.as I was waiting in the in the line to ride the ???

Thats a patient time about me alex and the help off my brother."	16
18153	Just as I finished eating my hamburger I noticed an old, crude excuse for a bus parked outside of the restaurant window. @CAPS1s that? I asked through my sgueky seven-year-old voice. My @CAPS3 responded, That bus takes people to the palace across the street, where @PERSON1s playing. @CAPS2t it be cool if we @CAPS4 go? I questioned. I saw my mom whisper something to my brother. It was then that they told me we were going to the show. Excitedly, I climbed into the back seat of our car and we drove across street to the palace of @ORGANIZATION1. It was huge! All I wanted to do was enter the marvelous building, but my @CAPS3 kept telling me we had to wait. About fifteen minutes later the two pepsis I had drinken earlier made it through my system @CAPS3, I have to go to the bathroom, I said over and over again. Finally, my @CAPS3 took me through the front doors. The inside of the building was even more fabulous than the outside! However, a rail of red rope blocked our way. @CAPS4 my son use the bathrooms? my @CAPS3 asked a lady who sat behind the front desk. She gave a cold ro and we were forced to return back to the car. Another fifteen minutes passed. The concert would start soon, so we returned to the building. This time the red rope had gone, but replaced by a line of nearly fifty people who were all waiting to get through the metal detector! It took almost @NUM1 minutes, but we made it to the front of line, we passed through the metal detector and took our seats. That was a true test of my patience, but it all was worth it when I was finally allowed to use the bathroom.	24
18852	There was a time when I had to wait on handling my personal have it. My sisters and I came into the house and one of them went to handle there personal have it while I was being patience to not you and knock hard on the door. Telling her (@ORGANIZATION1 or @CAPS1) to @CAPS3 in the whatever they doing. By the way @ORGANIZATION1 is @NUM1 years old and @CAPS1 is @NUM2 years old. Had waited and waited be very patience not to be laying @CAPS3 up, @CAPS4 on I really have to we handle my personal haveit  ??? something like that. It felt good to be very patience them to be a non patience people because think about when if you really have to handle something in the bathroom or restroom people will think you are a rushing ??? instead of a patience. Any way they will talk about it to anyone that he/she know at a bad thing when they are just talking about any thing. Last this not a time where e wait to patience to other.	10
19258	We were going to @CAPS1. Me and my cousins were so excited! We were waiting the to ride the skyline. After we ate, me my cousins and my??? headed for the skyline. The skyline gave you the whole??? of cedar point. im so excited said one of my sisters. yaa me too! said the the other. We were walking towards it. It took really long. When we saw the line we heaked! this will take so long said my sister. I was so surprised my @NUM1-year- ol cousin her??? ???. wow it look really high said my cousin. @CAPS2t, worry we have @CAPS3 with us. Shell take care of us said my younger sister. Finally it was our turn. There were @NUM1 small kids behind us. Wanting to go on so badly. why @CAPS2t you go ahead said my cousin. I was shocked my cousin had so much patience. Usually she had start wanting to go first for everything! I was so proud of my cousin. We had a great time there. I hope we come back again!	21
18979	A day that I was patient was, one day I was really happy about my birthday coming up. I couldnt wait to see @CAPS1 I was getting. I though about it for about a week begging my mom to tell me @CAPS1 I was getting. The days past and it fell like they got even longer and longer. I tried and tried day and day to try and take a peak at @CAPS1 I was getting, but I always got caught. So finally my mom told me to just stop thinking about it and be patient and it would name faster. So I waited, it seemed like it was takeing forever. The next day I woke up my brother came and jumped on me and said ah-ah I know @CAPS1 your getting and you dont. And I jumped up and said @CAPS1! How come you know and I dont? Thats bad tell me please And he said no then I got up and walked out the room and went to my mom and said I give up she looked and said just be patient and it will go by faster you only have four days left. then I walked away. Then days started to go by faster and then my birthday came up I was so happy to finally see @CAPS1 I was getting. And that was the day I was patient.	18
19162	One time when I waited game but I couldnt get yet .So I asked  my mom if can she buy me a new game, how much does it cause? @NUM1 dollars then she said you have to wait for some days the @NUM2 went by then I finally asked my mom can she buy for me she said well yet .I said thank you .Then the next morning we went to the game store, then I saw the game I wanted,I told my mom that we went to the counter and bought my game .	12
18847	One some day, it was about @NUM1. My mom woke me, my brother, and dad to get ready I dont know what we was getting ready far, but we get on the road as soon as we cloud. I fell back to sleep in the car when we were on the height. I woke up from a big @CAPS1 on the breaks and when I looked up, we were in a long line of cars, where are we?I ask six flags. @CAPS2 my brother. I could hear impatience people all around me. They were thinking screaming and yelling while people tried to pay their way into the park. It seem like we were moving faster than @CAPS3 of the fast people, and we was one of the first people to get in first. That was the @CAPS3 impatience group of people Id ever seen.	18
19410	One time I was patient was at the doctor, cause when I was little and I was at the doctor I was running around and did not give a care. I guess this time my mom did not trust me so she sat with me where ever I went. Mind you there were girls around so I got embarrased and asked mom why are you following me and she replyed cause I dont want you running everywhere. That when I told her mom I older now, Im not sorle years old, Im muture now. She said @CAPS1 go ahead so I went over sat next to some girls and talked to them. Thats when we got up and start walking around talking. I felt a little tingle in my head saying your mom is still following you so I turned around and she was not there. So we went to the snack room and sat down we ate and everything, and I so happen to look over and my mom was sitting at the third table away from us. Thats when went back on the elevator on the to our original place and sat down and to my surprise she was all ready there. That when I told the girl that I would be back and I sat next to my mom and said was you following me and she replied yes I mean no. so I had a talk with her and we came to an understanding. Soon enough it was my turn to go see the doctor. That is the end of my story.	16
17938	Patience is important in life. Something when you dont have patience things tend to go wrong and thats not always a good thing so here are somethings when you do not have patience. If you dont have patience you can get into trouble. For example if you were in a long line for something and you couldnt talk because if you did talk you would get in trouble. So if you didnt have any patience you would probably say @CAPS1 my gosh this is taking forever. Then you would get in trouble for talking. Here is another reason why you should have patience. You should have patience for an example if you didnt you would need patience if you were sick and you went to the doctors office and there was a really long line you would probably say for get it and then go home. So if you went home you would get even more sick and that would get even more sick and that would be bad. Finally, another reason on if you didnt have patience. For example say you wanted to go the mall and bye a new pair of shoes. You went into the store and you found a pair that you liked and they fit just right. But when you went to go check out the cash regaster didnt work so they had to call maitnence, to come and fix it and they told you that it would be an hour. So you sat and waited for twenty minutes but you did not have any patience so you said for get it and you left and didnt get the shoes. Those were some people who didnt have patience. But if they did that wouldnt of happened to them because they would of waited or needed. Having patience is a good thing but not having it is not.	9
19206	@CAPS1 The bell had finally rang and it was time for lunch. It felt like math class would never end. I rushed to lunch without even stopping at my locker. When I got there, there was a line for lunch that seemed like it stretched for a mile. I knew I was going to have to be patient. I got in the huge line. I stood there and waited. Every minute felt like an hour, but I understood that it was a very busy lunch day, so I justed waited. Several minutes later, I was near the front of the line. All of the sudden, seven girls just cutted in front of the line because their friend let them. Even though that made me angry, I didnt complain and stayed patient. I soon got my lunch. In conclusion, that was the time I was patient. I was understanding and did not complain.	16
19547	"A time I was patient was when I was at a dentist office I had to get six teeth pulled. When we where waiting I keep asking my mom ""when are we going when are we going."" When the said ""@CAPS1"" i waked into the room. I asked if i was going to hurt and they said you won't fell a thing."" The doctor put a tube on my mouth and said close your eyes and breath. with out even knowing I fell asleep from the gas. I was asleep for two hours and when I wanted to get out of the chair they said ""no, no, no"" so I sat and sat until @NUM1 minutes later they let me out I was all loope and had to be put in a wheel chair. When I got to the front desk they let me take two toys and my mom gave me wresteler. When we where about to leave my mom talk to the doctor and they took for  ever. When we got in the car my mom took the wheel chair back and we where off. during the ride my mom told me I couldn't go to school that day cause of my teeth. She said not to look in the mirror but I did and it was grass. I had to wait three hours for food and drinks d so I was thirsty. When she said I could eat I was happy. I am still patient cause the doctor said that grawn up teeth would come in a few months but it has been two years and nothing so I am disappointed, but now I have to be patient and wait for my mom to take me to get bcacies which is gonna hurt really bad."	18
19375	One day I was told we were going to @LOCATION1. We were getting there by this big fast boat called the jet exspress. So we had to wait in this big line. The boat was delayed so we were told it would be late. I shold of known I did not dress warmly and it was freezing. We were the first people in line so that was a go thing but I was being patient, I was not complaining or anything. When the boat finally arrived I was so relieved and my mom also thanked me for being patient and not complaining. That day turned out to be very nice and fun.	17
19292	One sunny after noon I was so waited because. I was going to see my faveret band. When Im in school! My mom picked me up from thired gread I was so excited it was time to go. My dad droped my broter of at my grandmas house (he was only at doy so he could not go.) I was bounsing of my seut mom are we there yet? I ask @CAPS1 we have two more houre to we are there, then a nother hour, so we are going to see the place here.mom said  @CAPS2, can I have my d.v.d please. I side. So now it has been two hours Iv been in the car. Then we went every were my mom and dad wanted to go not were I wanted to. Then it was time to go see. The @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5! When we aroved I was a little sleepy but that would not stop my. When they only plaed two song I want to sleep on the seet. I wated all day to see them and I went to see. That was a time I was patient to see my faveret band.	16
18202	One time my brother @PERSON1 was patient. Patience is being understanding and lisksent through difficultis without complaining. Our family lived in @LOCATION1 and were going to cedar point on vacation. We had fun all day end at @NUM1 we went on @ORGANIZATION1. @PERSON1 went on the blue @ORGANIZATION1 while the rest of the family went on the red. The blue keeps you up at the top for @NUM2 and drops you while the red one shoots you up to @NUM3 feet. The line for the red @ORGANIZATION1 was shorter than the blue one so we got to go on first. Once the ride was over @PERSON1 was already at the top of the blue @ORGANIZATION1. We heard a loud sound that ment the blue @ORGANIZATION1 cast was coming down. But the blue cast wasnt coming down. @PERSON1 was stuck at the top, @NUM4 feet in the air. @PERSON1 got a birds eye  of the park. I would have been scared if I were @PERSON1. At @NUM5 the ride lights came on and the cast plummed down. Finally,, he got a ride. Each ride got free season passes to cedar point. This is a time when @PERSON1 needed to show patience.	21
19165	Being patient is a hard task wright about. One day I was with my mom in @LOCATION1, looking for a pawn shop .We got stopped at nearly every red light on the way there .no one complained even when we reached a certain red light .Right before the light turned green a very old lady with a walker stepped infront of us we waited @NUM1 minutes for the old lady to pass .Supersising  still no one complained.	14
17920	"One time I was patient when I was in @LOCATION1 getting on a ride called ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2 parents @CAPS3."" @CAPS4 was a @CAPS5 long line and I'm usually saying ""@CAPS6 on!"" Or sometimes ""@CAPS7's go!"" @CAPS8, I was being @CAPS5 patient in the line. I was proud of my self and so was my mom. That was the time I was being patient."	14
18793	Once when I was a little boy, about seven years old I was extremely patient about an @CAPS1 toy I wanted. Ever since @CAPS1 The @CAPS3 @ORGANIZATION1 bender was on television and In stories now I was crazy about them and I still am today the @CAPS4 @CAPS5 the only person in the @CAPS1 world who can master all four element @CAPS7, @LOCATION1, @CAPS8, @ORGANIZATION1 . Now I can write you a whole entire book about the @CAPS1. So I saw a @CAPS1 had set on t.v. so I asked my mom could she buy it. And she said when I get the money, but until then no. so of course I was upset. So I was waiting counting until the days went buy. Then final that very @CAPS12 came, and you know what that means. @CAPS11 @CAPS12 the @CAPS12 has arrived the @CAPS12 I get my toy but I didn`t know that she only got two hundred dollars so I had to wait another week. I was so upset that I ran up steair and locked my door and cryed myself to sleep. My birthday was coming up. I was so upset that I forgot all about the @CAPS12 and when my birthday was here can guess what? I finally got the best of all. The @CAPS4 and my mom said that all that patients you did got what you wanted.	24
18570	There once was a little girl named @PERSON2 @CAPS10 was the important girl in the land of narrative. Narrative was a little land felled with loveing and patient people who waited for everything. And every child was patient but @PERSON2. @PERSON2 was a only child living with her mother and @CAPS12. @PERSON2 hated being the only child so: @PERSON2`s mother named @CAPS3 told her husband @CAPS1 that they should have another chilled so that @PERSON2 would not be only. Soon they told @PERSON2 that @CAPS10 would be having a little brother or sister @PERSON2 was very happy. Infact @PERSON2 was so happy that @CAPS10 ran up stairs and began to make up baby names. Then ran down stairs and shared them with her mother rocking in her chain. I like kuven said @CAPS12 walking toward the dinner table were @PERSON2 and her mother where siting. Ok said @PERSON2 cleaning the table of Do you like @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @LOCATION1, @CAPS4, @CAPS5 or @CAPS6said. @PERSON2. I like @PERSON1 said @CAPS12 pushing in his chair. Me as well said mother walking up stairs toward her bed room. I can`t wait till the baby gets here said @PERSON2 on her way up the stairs. The next morning @PERSON2 a woken early to see if her mother had the baby. @CAPS7 you have the baby yet said @PERSON2 weaking up her mother and @CAPS12 @CAPS8 said the @CAPS12, the baby haves to grow inside of mommy okay.

18291	What is patience? Patience is the act of thing understanding, tolerate and experiencing difficulties without complaining. I am going to tell you a little story of what every parent has to go through that requires a lot of patience. My baby brother, @PERSON1 was born @DATE1. Since birth my mother has dreaded the day of potty training whom she knew would be coming soon. As you @DATE1 know the price of diapers and pull-ups has gotten pretty expensive so when @PERSON1 turned @NUM1 years started potty training. Potty training requires alot of patience because sometimes the child @DATE1 not go to the potty and @DATE1 go on or herself. My mom knows this but she still gets pretty mad when @PERSON1 decides to use the bathroom on himself. At other times, mom becomes very patient because she knows this is all knew to him and that he is still a small child. My mom is still working on being patient but she knows that soon @PERSON1 will be olde to use the bathroom or the toilet by himself without wearing a pull-up. Many good things can come out of just being patient.	22
18500	I was patient when it was my birthday and I didnt get anything. I thought I would get at least one thing but I got nothing. I didnt do anything wrong but still I got nothing. The next day I got nothing I didnt ask for anything but I still got nothing. The next day I got nothing. But that night while it was skating at skate port @NUM1 got nothing. Like at @TIME1 I saw my cousin and she gave me @MONEY1 for my birthday. I thought that everyone forgot but I was wrong. I was so happy too. I had to be patient in order to get something and dont have to ask for something.	20
18057	The place I was paitent it was at my moms doctor appointment. It was a little healthcare place at @LOCATION1 road and it was small and I had to wait out at the lobby and it was boring. I first started watching chanel @NUM1 news it got intrusting. Then I went at the front counter got a blue pen plank piece of paper then begun drawing when I finish drawing  it look like a car that look as, it was a far car; and then I began looking something to do. I begaing finding and finding and then ther  was a car magazine and there was cool cars low riders, exotic, costome, and more.When my mom was done I was patient and then we left home	14
19089	Being patient is one of the many important things in life that we have to deal with if you are impatient, and then people will say that you are impatient, and needs to calm down. Being patient also means that you are polite person and that you will not complain about anything, also that whatever happens, you will be understanding and you will wait. Let`s say somebody was in a line to get food. You would have to wait your turn in order to get your food while the other person is getting his/her food. That is being an understanding and polite person and sometimes even a role model for litter children/ kids. You are setting an example and being considerate. These are many reasons on why being patient takes understanding, and being considerate.	12
19477	Im not a very patient person. I always whine and complain. If patient means you stay somewhere for a whole without complaining, then I guess there are some times when Ive been patient, but only if there is a friend there to keep me busy. One time, my mom was at the hospital for a long time, about @NUM1 hours. My friend @PERSON1 was there, and we hung out together. It was actually a lot of fun. We ate in the cafeteria place. We stole some milk for no reason, and totally forgot that my mom was there. I didnt complaine once. Then we got yelled at and had to go back to the waiting room, but it still wasnt too bad. that was one of the few times Ive been  patient, and dont know if it counts since I was with somebody.	16
19155	I used patience when I went to ceder point @CAPS1 I used it was that I playing video game. As I was packing I grabed my psp I put in my bag. So I was bored half ??? down there so I grabed my psp and ??? so I lost track of ???.As we ??? my girls did and we ??? pulling in to the hostel we were so close to the park but as soon as I got there I ??? long my patience. We got in line we went sitting their forever so I playing my psp. The psp helped me use patience. I??? My psp to help. It would have been hard but my psp test my mind ???	12
18495	It was a @DATE1 @TIME1 at school so boring as usal and my @CAPS1 came in on cruches I freaked out and, ran over to her and she told me she broke her leg and that she wasnt allowed to hang out for a whole month. It was hard waiting a whole month to hangout with her but, her safety was more important than my amusement. It was @NUM1 weeks after my friend breaking her leg out, I was doin well of not bothering he so I was proud of myself, but I got to help her around school. It was a few more weeks later she was almost better so I was excited and went and bought her a gift. The next @DATE1 @PERSON1 was out of the crauches and, cast and back on her foot thats the story of the time I was patient.	16
19242	I remember one time I was impatient, it was when my called and said she was go send me @NUM1$. @CAPS1 I asked her when she was to send it and she said @DATE3. Today was @DATE4 so that mean I had to @NUM2 days. @CAPS1 the next day had cameup  and the ???  truck came by and I thought I had mony but it wasnt @DATE3 yet, @CAPS1 I said, @CAPS2. @DATE1 came, I was still waiting so I tried going to the day can past by  @CAPS3 it! So @CAPS1 it was @DATE2 they had my favorite game on sale The bully the case had a yellow sticker that @NUM3 and no tax at all,@CAPS1 I was mad and @CAPS4 went home. My dad woke me up and said its @DATE3  I @CAPS1 I rose up ate breakfast @CAPS1 check the mail, @CAPS1 it bills, bills,bills and  my money my sent we an ???. At last I said I have money, so I bought some icecream @CAPS1 I bought my favorite game bully. thats the time when I was patient.	17
19207	During the @DATE1 between forth and fifth grade, my family and I went to @LOCATION1 @CAPS1! @CAPS4 of the rides had lines, but none of them had line as long and the @CAPS2  @CAPS3. The line was huge! As my brothers, their best friend and I approached the @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @CAPS5 thought @CAPS5 would never get on. My dad said to just wait, but @CAPS5 didnt see the point. When @CAPS5 got about half way, one of the employees shouted, @NUM1 more minutes! and @CAPS5 @CAPS4 became more excited. Eventually, @CAPS5 made to the front of the line! @CAPS4 @CAPS5 had to do was wait for the current trial was over! But then, the speaker came on, @CAPS4 rides must stop until told to continue. A thunderstorm has rolled in and @CAPS5 must because of safety issues. @CAPS5 had @CAPS4 considered leaving, but had a feeling @CAPS5 shouldnt. @CAPS5 talked with some other kids @CAPS5 met in line. @CAPS5 played games like rocks, paper, scissors while @CAPS5 waited under the pavillion above the line. Once the storm rolled away, they allowed us on! The ride was a thrill! I had wind in my hair, a small mist from the rain, and a thankyou from my dad  for keeping us in line.	22
19018	We all don`t like waiting like waiting, but we have to learn to be patient. @DATE1 @DATE1 @DATE1 when I went to @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 I had to be patient for a lot of things. I had to be patient when waiting in the airport and using public transportation. Being patient means you are understanding and tolerant. Over my trip I had to do a lot of waiting in airports. While still being patient. Being extra patient was important when waiting for you flight to be called. Another place to be patient was when I had to wait for my bag to come on the baggage carousel. Another long wait to be patient at airport security. To sum up, you have. To be patient in waiting in airports. When I went to @LOCATION1 @DATE1 I had to be patient when using public transportation. When waiting for a train to arrive it was rush hour and the train was full. When I was in the taxi and there was traffic outside. I relaxed and was patient. To conclude, I had to be patient when using public transportation. I still dont like waiting in line but I am patient when I do. I learned patience when waiting and being, but it`s something we have to do.	17
19508	The time I was patient was last @DATE1 when we went to the cedar point. When we went to cedar point there was a long line when we got to the front of the line the machine broke. @CAPS1 we had to go to a nother ride and I couldnt wait @CAPS1 long because I had to go to the bathroom @CAPS1 I walked out of line and went to the bathroom. When I came back there were more people in line @CAPS1 I just waited.	12
18698	There havent been many times were I was patient but Im going to tell you about when I was patient. One time when I was patient was when I was riding home on the bus. My bus driver @PERSON1 mede me sit in the back because she said I talked too much and that I wasnt aloud to talk the whole ride home. It was hard at first but then I did my homework. Which gave me something to do. That was one time I was patient but not the only time. Another time when I was patient was standing in line for a rollercoaster at cedar paint. The beginning of the line said that it was a @NUM1 hour wait but we didnt care because it was my friends and my favorite ride, it wasnt so bad because its all worth it when you ride the ride. Those were times I were patient but Ive had to wait patiently even longer than that!	13
19002	I remember a time when someone I know was patient with me. It was near the beginning of the @NUM1 grade. I had enrolled in band that year, playing the trumpet. We played songs and had tests to everyone we were playing right. But on my tests, my band teacher <@NUM2</PERSON> noticed something funny on my tests. I was playing the wrong notes. He told me I needed a long  private lesson if I wanted to play my notes right. So one afternoon after school. I took the lesson. I started by playing my notes for him. He said they were wrong. Then <@NUM2</PERSON> broke down the notes for us one by one. He told me  the correct way to play the notes. He had me play the notes again and again and together. When I messed up, he showed me how to play them being ?? patient with me. Then  finally I was playing every note .The lesson was about @NUM4 minutes and he was patient the entire process. Now i play my notes right thats to the lesson and @PERSON1s patience. Now I know that if I need more lessons in the future, I can count on <@NUM2</PERSON>s patience to come out or there is ?? required classes.	19
18791	To be considered patient, you must be tolerant and understanding,and you cannot complain. I love babysitting my little cousin, especially when they are still infants. This @DATE1, I went to my cousins house to watch her daughter @CAPS1 @PERSON1 , for about three hours. I was getting paid fifty dollars, and I couldnt wait.When I got to their house, @NUM1 was sleeping , and I woke her up as soon as her mom left. As soon as I did that, I figured it was a bad idea she started screaming at the top of her lungs. I picked her up, rocked her, played games, put her in the swing , and even tried to feed her but nothing worked. I was so upset, I fell like screaming. The baby cried for an hour and a half, and wouldnt hush. Tthen I said,  @NUM1 , whats the matter ? @CAPS2 I spoke, there was a moment of silence, she had stopped crying. At that moment, I realized I was being patient because  I stayed somewhat calm and I didnt complain to @CAPS1@CAPS4s mom.	23
18960	Book @CAPS1 And the characters lived happily ever after..for now! @CAPS2! @LOCATION1 shut the book, very sad that no more pages were left. This was the third book in her series, and she absolutely just needed the fourth. In the school the next day, she went straight to the library. She opened the doors, and was greeted with that dusty old book smell that she loved.  @LOCATION1 made a bee line for her favorite shelf, holding her favorite books. @LOCATION1 scanned the shelfs, quickly noticing the book was missing. She @CAPS11 the librarian, @PERSON2, about @CAPS12, and was surprised to find the book checked out already. She put her name on the waiting list, sour about her name being tenth. The next day was @DATE1. @LOCATION1 went to the library @CAPS11 @PERSON1 @PERSON2 about the book. The results were very disappointing. Her name was @NUM1, which was pretty good for only one day, @CAPS6 when she was home, she was in a very sour mood. @CAPS3s wrong! @CAPS11 her mom. @CAPS4, I really wanted this book, @CAPS6 @CAPS12 was already checked out. My name is @NUM1 on the list, @CAPS6 @CAPS12 could be ages until those other people finish. @CAPS4, I think you have to learn some patience said mom. Patience? @CAPS3s that? @CAPS11 @LOCATION1 Patience is when you wait for something, and you dont complain about @CAPS12. Take you, for example, your being very impatient. @CAPS6 Im waiting said @CAPS7 @CAPS8, @CAPS6 you are complaning a whole lot. The next day, @LOCATION1 was as patient as she could be. She did not go to the library and ask for the book, and she went the whole without complaining. Later on. @LOCATION1 was called to the office. When she got there, she found @PERSON2 and @PERSON1, the secretary. @CAPS9 said @PERSON2. @CAPS3s this? @CAPS11 @LOCATION1 @CAPS12 is the book you wanted. @CAPS12s checked out to your acount, and all ready to read. @CAPS13 you said @LOCATION1. She couldnt belive @CAPS12! She finally got her book! Moral: patience pays off, especially when your willing to wait.	24
19232	One day when I was patient is when I was waiting was waiting @CAPS1 @NUM1 to come out of game stop. One day til  @CAPS1 @NUM1 come out I kept looking at the signs of the game and I said @CAPS2 must be a good game. So instead of waiting at game stop I went home and played @ORGANIZATION1 football @NUM3 on my xbox @NUM4 then I got tired , tired and more tired so I fell aslteep on my pep game chair  till the morning. My older brother woke up and said lets go to gamestop to get @CAPS1. So we went to game stop and waited in a long line for like an hour and thirty minutes til in was  are turn to buy @CAPS1 it  cost like @MONEY2. I had @MONEY3 my brother had @MONEY1 he didnt wanna put no money in for the game and I said Ill pay @MONEY3 and you will @MONEY1. So we brought the game and played it tell we beat it.	17
18242	One day at the fair I was patient. I wanted to ride the bumper cars. So I got in line. There where about @NUM1 people in front of me so I knew I had to be patient. So I waited in line until it was my turn. They let @NUM2 people in at a time so it took a while for me to get my turn. Then it was my turn. I wanted to go with my friends so we let some people got in front of us. Then after @NUM3 minutes it was our turn we picked our car and had some fun. That's a time when I was patient.	16
18817	One time there were two twin chipmunks, there names were @PERSON1 and @PERSON1 always had patience A.J not so much. One day it was sunny with a cool breeze. A.J. decided he wanted to go on a trip with @PERSON1. So they packed up there camping gear and headed farther into the woods it was around dusk when they reached were they wanted to be. So they tried to build a fire, @LOCATION1 started gathering firewood and tried to start the fire how there mom and dad had taught them. As l said in the first part @LOCATION1 has no patience so he kept on trying but after awile he stopped he would hit the rocks together once and it wouldnt start so @PERSON1 tried in @NUM1 minute he got it started. A.J. didnt care he got the acorns and started cookin. But every time hed only leave them on for @NUM2 seconds so he tried and tried finally he just stopped well it @PERSON1 @NUM2 minutes, @LOCATION1 was really mad now so they went to bed. When @PERSON1 woke up in the morning he found @LOCATION1 cooking breakfast. A.J finally learned to be patient.	20
18575	There once was a time when someone I knew was patient. I was a cold @DATE1 day and I was at school. My teacher was very sick so we had a substitute. He was a very mean substitute. All of a sudden a kid started breathing heavy. He needed his inhaler. I told the sub the kid needed to get it but he said no. the person next to me said the say thing, but she was patient and said okay @CAPS1 the sub let the kid go. That was time a person I know was patient.	15
19305	A person I know that is patient was my old teacher named @PERSON1. He was a very patient man although we got on his nerves. It we didnt understand a question that he explained a million times he was still patient. Even when we got attitudes with @PERSON1 he was still a patient man. I think @PERSON1 was determined to be patient with us as he must of prayed because he was always patient with us through thick and thin. @PERSON1 was the most patient teacher and person Ive ever ???	17
18220	One time I was patient was when I was at basketball practice. It didnt happen until the end. no one knew that this was going to happen. It just happened out of nowhere. I hit the wall. I had an accident. We were running suicides. I was running to fast and I couldnt stop. I went head-first  into the wall. It was a brick wall too. I didnt panic because I knew I had to be patient. I had to wait on a lot of things. I had to wait on an ambulance, which took a long time. I had to wait on a doctor to give me stitches which didnt take long. Lastly I had to wait on the doctor to give me the discharge papers. It happened here at @ORGANIZATION1 . We were in the gym for basketball practice. It was in the @DATE1 but I cant remember the exact date. I was also in the sixth grade. It happened because I couldnt stop in time. When I hit my head it didnt hurt. When I got my stitches some parts hurted. When they took them out it didnt hurt. But I had massive headache. I was glad when everything was over.	21
19323	I was patient when I was going to the docteis to get???  ??? I didnt complan about it. I had to wait for @NUM1 hours. Then when I went in thay toke a couple of ways it toke about @NUM2 hour. Then thay take some tests then at the end I finally went home. That was the time I was patient.	13
18256	This @DATE1 I went to @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 the part cucry one forgets is the @NUM1 hour plane ride. We were in a group of @NUM2 familis all my friends. When we become the plane we were an exited, @CAPS1 on gate were scattered all over. So I sat with my @NUM3 favorite friends in that trip. We were all loaded with as electicails the enemes. As we foot on I thought @CAPS3 was going to be a breeze, @CAPS1 thought wrong. At first @CAPS3 was fine we talkes and played games in our I pods and sort, @CAPS1 after like @NUM2 hours we started setting itchy and our I pods died. So then we decided to watch a movie as our mind dvd player. @CAPS3 was starling to irn low on battery and the plan was broken. The thing died and we still had like another @NUM2 hours and we only got to watch one movie. On the back of each seat there was a tv so we forced @CAPS3 on, @CAPS1 @CAPS3 was one of @NUM6 of the???did not ???. We started to see really??? and @CAPS3 was getting late.

We did nothing. @CAPS1 as we wanted we bolted out of our seats and into the air read @CAPS3 was over. We didn't have to be patient no longer.	22
19145	Have you ever babysitted little kids? If you have, then you know how much patience it requires. It was my little cousins third birthday party, and as the oldest child, it was my responsibility to watch the younger kids. At first, everything was going fine. The kids were quietly playing with the plastic kitchen, offering me fake food. Then one of them started to play with the ball popper. Of course, if one child has a new toy, the rest of them immediately stop what theyre doing and go play with the toy, too. So all of the little kids gathered around the ball pepper, giggling with delight as the machine spot plastic balls out into the air. Suddenly, a little girl reached out and snatched a ball from the air, causing the other kids to fight over the balls and scream. I yelled at them to stop, but when they ignored me and kept fighting, I realized that this would require a lot of patience. I calmly took the ball popper away and waited for them to settle down. Thankfully, my little cousins stopped fighting and were able to play with the ball pepper quietly. I learned an important lesson from my cousins birthday party  babysitting requires a lot of patience!	24
18717	Patience is a key role in life. If you are not paitent, you will live an unhappy life. Almost everything in life calls for patience. If you are not patient, you will most likely arrous something up like your job if you are not patient with your boss or co- workers. I often have a hard time being patient with my mom and dad. Sometimes I just cant stand my parents anymore and I lose my temper and become impatient with them and that usually makes things worse for me. I do love my brother but he can get really annoying, like most little brothers and sisters do. When my brother gets on my nerves, I become very impatient with him. Sometimes I will get so mad and impatient with him I will just lose it and I always get in trouble when I beat on him and I would always end up being the bad guy because of my patience. Now that I am older and I realize how important it is to be patient with people, it makes life a whole lot easier and fun with the people. Im around everyday and that is why when you are patient, you will get your way, but when you are impatient because you are trying to get yor way, it will never happen.	12
18788	I elevator tapping my foot, smooth jazz music humms out of speakers above me. Eventually the all too familiar click was head and the smooth metal doors slid open to reveal a well furnished hallway with many other people waiting @CAPS6 their turn of departure on the ??? I slipped out, trying now to become trampled by the massive crowd, then, silence. My footsteps echoed off the ??? as I searched @CAPS6 room @NUM1. Finnaly finding my destination I open the door and step inside where many other squirring children are waiting. I remove my coat and hang it on a nearby hook, trying not to draw too much attention to myself. I continue by searching through the magazine section, torn up @CAPS1 magazines and delicately handled sports illustrated are flipped through until I find an interesting looking article on swimming. Magazines under my arm I choose a seat in the far corner to wait in. Minutes pass, I can tell that the child next to me is becoming impatient fast, he taps his mothers jacket repeatedly and asks the same thing he did @NUM2 minutes ago, @CAPS2 how much longer? The mother checks her watch and in a closely annoyed tone replies, not much longer now dear. @CAPS3, the little boy slumps back in his seat and jams his thumb into his mouth to keep him occupied. I roll my eyes, but cant help but crack a smile at his actions. Somewhere across the room, a girl about my age frowns as @CAPS5 texts on her cellphone, after a quick glance at the clock @CAPS5 scowls and continues. Just then, the glass door slides open and a woman with a homemade perm and tired eyes steps out. Across the waiting room, patients look up at her, their eyes full of anticipation and hope. @PERSON1  the doctor is ready to see you now. @CAPS4, I avoid the angry glares from other patients and follow her out the door. You know its funny, @CAPS5 says well snapping her gum. @CAPS6 someone. So young you were the most patient person out there! I merely nod my head and grin because I understand that patient people, experience difficulties without complaining and I am very grateful that Im a patient person.  stand in the	24
18053	I know a girl, shes my friend, and her name is @PERSON1. @PERSON1 is a very good person. She eats all her veggies, does all her-home work, and has straigt As. @PERSON1 only has one problem. She is not patient. One day @PERSON1 and I went to the movie theater. We went on a saterday night so it was quite busy. There was a long line to @CAPS2 the tickets. @PERSON1 looked at me and groaned. I told her, @CAPS1 patient @PERSON1, it will only take like ten minutes. @PERSON1 groaned again and crossed her arms. @CAPS2 over it you potato sak, I told her. After about two minutes we were only five people behind the ticket counter. @PERSON1 was pacing around like she was in the worst case senerio. She started pulling her hair as I stared blankly at her. She ran to me and said, @PERSON2, we gotta @CAPS2 to that counter before I explode! I looked at her with my, why dont you just shut-up, eyes. Then she nodded. I stayed patient with @PERSON1 through out the night making sure she didnt go crazy. I made sure that I kept my cool so I could make sure we didnt @CAPS2 kicked out. You should always @CAPS1 patient or things @MONTH1 turn out bad.	24
19493	every school year I wait patiently for @DATE1 vacation. It fell like a a terify waiting for @DATE1 but it is werth it.	6
19334	To me,  patient is one of the most important traits in a person. To be patient with someone is very important. It can make you friends, it can get you a girl or boy friend and it can get you some of the best things in life. One time, patients got me a now hockey stick. About a month ago, I broke my old hockey stick in an away game. After the game, I knew I needed a new hockey stick, so I went to the pro shop at the ice areana I was playing at. Do you have the @CAPS1 @PERSON1 vapor @NUM1? I asked wondering if it would easy to get it. @CAPS2 buddy we just ran out. @CAPS3 the sales man giving me a little shrug. I knew that if I wanted the stick. I would have to look harder. When I got home, I looked on the internet to see if there were any stores nearby with it in stock. No luck. I guess Ill have to order it online. I thought to myself. The delivery didnt grive  quickly. It took about @NUM2 weeks for it to arrive. It was worth all the time and effort.	15
18337	This is the story about the time I was patient. It was a warm day and I was sitting on the grass with the radio on. As my favorite song went off I reached to change the program. But when I heard the man say usher tickets on sell that and then I frozzes to listen, the tickets were going on sell down town. I told my mom and she rushed in the car and got dozen there so fast you wouldnt even see us leave. When I got to the line it was so long it seem like it go on forever. I waited and waited it felt like it only moved on an inch. Ti waited and still waited I beagin to get mad but I stood in line. Which my long wait was over I begain to jump for joy. As I walked to the concer she said sorry we are all sold out. I couldnt believe it I begain to scream my head out. I did all that waiting for nothing it was so unfair. And thats the time I was patient for noting.	21
18296	The time I was patients with my little brothers! I was baby sitting and they wouldnt lison to me or my other sister and I just relaxed and got on the floor and played with them after that all went well.	8

18548	Pacience is a talent that is difficult to master. Pacience is a mental game. Pacience comes in everyones life. If you have no pacience then therefore you have more anger. Pacience for those minors stuck in a mine for two months. College takes a seal of years. Pacience is required there also. Pacience is among people everywhere whether its waiting for a toy or waiting for god  to save your pacience is something that will stay here forever.	10
19119	On @DATE1 me and my two friends were all laughing out but then I had rememberd that in @NUM1 min I had to eat dinner. So I walked inside and my friends were being so patient. They didnt leave me and so I hurried as fast as I could so I didnt keep them waiting. After I got done we went back up to the park and swang on the swing. Then we walked back to my home because they had to leave and go home. That was my @DATE1. It was a fun one.	14
18080	I think patience means when your calm and you don't care what somebody @CAPS1 @CAPS2 doing, @CAPS3 @CAPS4 of patience @CAPS2 when your mom @CAPS2 shopping for a long time and you want to go to the video game store and you stay there that a good sill of patience a bad sign of patience @CAPS2 when you throw a bit of the store, @CAPS6 good sign of patience @CAPS2 when your at @CAPS3 amusement park and theres a @CAPS7 long line And you don't complain that's a very good sign of patience . A bad sign of patience In that situation @CAPS2 that you complian the whole time. . @CAPS6 good sign of patience @CAPS2 when you are waiting for your big sister to get out of the bathroom and you just wait until she gets out. A bad sign of patience @CAPS2 when you brake down the door and you have to pay for @CAPS9. Asked @CAPS6 good sign of patience. @CAPS2 when your locked out and for go to your friends house.	8

It was almost @DATE1 @CAPS1 @DATE1 and I m kept asking for @DATE1 presents, but @DATE1 mom kept saying no. it was getting closer and closer and I kept asking, until @DATE1 mom said be patient you will get them don't worry, but of course I had a hard  time being patient.

19226	When my friend and I went to @ORGANIZATION1, it was very busy. We dint have to wait a long time , @CAPS1 my ride we ??? to wait a longtime  to get on @CAPS1 my friend  was very patiente and I was not. I kept complaining on how long it took. @CAPS1 eventually we got on the ride and had a blast. It was horrible waiting, @CAPS1 it was worth it because the ride was the @ORGANIZATION2. It's the best ride in the whole wide world.	14
18615	When I was little we went to @ORGANIZATION1. I was finally big enugh to go on the newest @CAPS1 @CAPS2 ! When we walked up to the line we noticed how many people were there. The line looked as if it were five miles long ! My mom asked me if I wanted to keep going in the huge line or go next time when less people were there. This is what I had been waiting for ! I was not oppernutity. I told her I wanted to keep going and so we kept walking. It took what felt like two days to get to top. My mom and I were so patient !So we waited ,and waited ,and waited .Till we were finally at the top .Then we came down .It had been worth the wait ! we were so patient. I will always remember all the fun I had that day and the great accomplishment. I never knew I could be so patient and my mom and I could wait so long.	17
18593	Patience can lead to rewards, @PERSON4 the brown bear learned that @DATE1 when he was in line to get an autograph from @PERSON1. He might have been very frustrated but he just stayed calm and looked forward to meeting @PERSON3. One day @PERSON4 seen a @CAPS1 @CAPS2 headline in a newspaper. He put @NUM1 in the machine and opened the newspaper holder to grad one, it was jammed.  He went into the gas station to tell the people but they were not there, he hit the top of the bell and nobody came .@PERSON4 was trying to be as patient as possible .He went to a different store and got newspaper there. The @CAPS1 @CAPS2  was  that his favorite star ,@PERSON2 ,was going to be in town  .Can hurried  to buggle town and seen the line that was @NUM2 long ???.He was so excited to see @PERSON3. @PERSON4 got to the line at @TIME2 and has been there for @NUM3 hour and she only got @NUM4 autographs done .This was going to be a long day for @PERSON4. @PERSON4 got a hot dog and  a soda from the sidewalle food business  at @NUM5 p.m .@PERSON4 was still the last person in line his patience went down quite a bit .At @TIME3 there were only @NUM6  people  including him there . He finally got to @PERSON3 at @TIME4 @PERSON3 and her crew notified @PERSON4 that he won the patience contest .They told him be gets to see her in concert, gets  her phone number  and wins a date with her.

That is when @PERSON4 learned that patience can pay off in the end.	22
18110	A time when I was patient was @NUM1 for @CAPS1. My mom told my she was getting me a @ORGANIZATION1 fo @CAPS1 I was so happy then when @CAPS1 come and I was opening my presents there was no @ORGANIZATION1. So I asked her about it she said she would get it @DATE1 when taxes came so I had to be patient and wait for @NUM2 months and a couple of days. I was mad cause I thought she had it. So I just had to go to school and wait and wait until @DATE1 came. It seemed like the days got longer and longer. I was getting mader and mader that was the longest @NUM2 months ever I didnt even know it could feel so long like that I though a year went by. Ater @DATE2 went by it was finally @DATE1 but I didnt get it to like the end of the month that just crushed my little heart so bodly to wait for some thing that long that I wanted so bad. When I got it was so fuh to play with all the games and apps and the conqurors is it was amazing.If something was to happen to it I would be destroyed. A @ORGANIZATION1 is expensive, but once you get it you have to take care of it. Thats why is keeping in a special place away from little kids. I dont even let them play with it at all and if I feel hide they might can play with my supervision thats the only time they can play. That thing cost to much money to get lost or broken. Specially after all that time I had to wait. My little sister is getting some thing like it but its some kind educational one. My little brother is getting, a ds..Im happy they getting some thing they can stop asking for my stuff. My mom is getting me some games to it for my birthday I had one but my little brother or sister lost it I was so angry how they cant play it at all. That was defenitly some thing to wait and be patient about. Thats why??? can play it because Im saved of il getting lost or broke. If it does my mom wont get another one.	20
18503	One time I was patient was I went to the doctors office. Yesterday I went to the doctors office and the waiting room was so full that we had to stand. Because there were so many people waiting we had to wait along with them. We were number @NUM1, and it took us @NUM2 hours just to get to sit down! It took a lot of patience because the waiting room time + the time waiting for a doctor about @NUM3 hours. When I finally got in I felt @NUM4 releived! It felt like I had an elephant lifted off my shoulders. Even though it took a long time, it was worth it now I am feeling better and back in school!	16
18709	"I was off, I was off to the onto rama to be exact. @CAPS3 @CAPS1 got to see a whole bunch of cool old cars, @CAPS1 also got to see some old ones. Some cars were old and rusty and some are new and state of the art. @CAPS4 @CAPS1 saw a sign. It read come see chip foose! So @CAPS1 went and looked around."" @CAPS1 found him! I exclaimed. ""@CAPS2"" @CAPS8 brother yelled."" @CAPS3 is!"" @CAPS4 @CAPS1 went and looked at the end of the line. It was @CAPS5! So @CAPS1 figured to would die down after a half an hour. @CAPS1 were very wrong. It was @CAPS5! The line @CAPS1 thought was big was nothing compared to the line now so @CAPS1 had to wait, and wait, and wait. @CAPS8 brother go to the point to where he could run a mile if he didn't he was going to explode. So I had to go walk around with him. I was relived because standing and doing nothing for @NUM1 hours gets boreing real fast. I was getting to the point where I had to get up and walk around or I was going to fun asleep. So I went for a walk with him. @CAPS1 got back and I sat back down @CAPS1 waited, and waited, and waited and waited. @CAPS4 @CAPS1 heard stop!"" @CAPS6 body behind these people have to go and come back after the break."" @CAPS7 the security guard. @CAPS1 were the last people. The people in front of us was a nerdy couple who had no life. @CAPS8 brother started to cry because he didn't get fooses autograph. The kind nerdy couple @CAPS7 ""here have our spat @CAPS1 have all day and you @CAPS2 like you really wanted this autograph."" @CAPS8 brother replied ""sniff @CAPS9 won't it!!"" @CAPS1 got it after 51/@NUM1 hours of waiting and waiting and waiting and dying. That was the time I had to be patient."	19
19149	Usually I have very little patience (and yes I do know that patience is a virtue), but on my birthday a few years ago, I had to stay in a hospitle room with any dad to spend time with my mom, @CAPS1 was very boring, but somehow I managed to go the whole day (up to where my dad finally let me watch @CAPS2.V. in the room) without being baerd to tears.	9
19366	Being patient, what does it mean? It means that; you are understanding and tolerant. A patient person experiences difficulties without complaining. @CAPS1, being a patient person is difficult. One time, it was hard for me to be a patient person, I didnt complain though. I was overjoyed to be going to a water park on my birthday. I wanted to party and get my swim on but it was almost @NUM1 weeks away. I didnt want to wait any longer, but I knew that being patient would make my experience even better. I was tolerant, understanding, and patient. The week dragged on. I wanted to complain and rip my hair out because it was like the earth was turning @NUM2, @NUM3 times slower, but I knew that I couldnt! When the thought of me going to the water park got stuck in my brain like glue, the problem was clear. If I didnt think about it, time would fly by again. I had to be patient because I didnt want to annoy anyone with my complaints. When the day came, I had a blast. Being patient always turns out good!	17
18915	Have you ever been patient? I have, one time me, my mom, my dad, and sister went to @CAPS1. When we got there they gave us a number and told us to wait. I was being patient, sitting there quietly waiting. Then @NUM1 later we got a table. We all sat down and told our waitress what we wanted to drink. Then we all looked at the menus and found out what we wanted. The waitress came back and asked us what we wanted to eat. I said steak and so did my dad, my mum and sister got mini tocos. She said ok, and that our food would be out shortly. Well it turns out she was way off. We were sitting there for @NUM2. My mom wanted to leave but the rest of us said no and waited patiently. Finnaly after @NUM2 @NUM4. Our food came out and were were glad. The only bad part about that was the mini tocos were frozen solid. So we just asked for our bill. The waitress came back and gave us the bill, luckily that wasnt frozen solid. We paid our bill left no tip and left. After that my mom thanked me for being so patient and we never went there again.	19
18131	I thought that when I got hurt during football and was on a stretcher, everyone was patient. They understood that I could only go a cartair spare and waited for me in the hallways and carried my stud from room to room. An example of someone showing this patience was @CAPS1 @PERSON2 had to hurry to go to the bathroom but walked with me slowly so I wouldn't be alone. Another example of someone being patient with me is @PERSON1. Lauren was patient with me  when I asked her.???????????	15
18267	Patience can really help you in life some times its the only thing that can keep us sane. Patience is important. Just like how my dog ran away and Im waiting for her to come back. Sometimes you'll get in a sitchation were your waiting for someone but there is always only one choice, to wait or be patient.	11
19373	I think patience is like somebody or someone is waiting for someone to get out of the bathroom then the other person can go to the bathroom. Like I am not in patience because I want to go a store now but they said wait your patience. My whole family is not in patience but my friends are.	6
19198	Have you ever wanted something to be done and your parents told you@CAPS1 be patient? Recently @CAPS2 been patient. My family got a new microwave and its too big for our counter so we had to put it above our stove. Well there wasnt enough space above the stove so my parents decided to remadle the whole kitchen. My step mom took everything out of the kichen and put it all over dinning room, and now we can barely walk in the dinning room .Lately my family has been eating in our living room. (@CAPS3) I really dont like eating in our living room it @CAPS1 seems so gross. But we also have the option to eat outside on our porch. So thats a good thing. Idont know how much longer I can keep up with this. But @CAPS2 @CAPS1 got to be patient. Finally now my dad has made a new shelf and he can put up our new microwave, finish painting, and put our stove back. After he did that my step mom put all of our seasonings back and our other stuff away and how we are back to normal. After being patient it really pays off. Now you know to always be patient.	21
19445	 @CAPS1 can I get a puppy .  @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS1 @CAPS4 in the @DATE1 just be patient.  @CAPS5. @CAPS6 @CAPS7 made her way down stairs to sulk she thinks of a briliant plan to make the @NUM1 days until @DATE1 go faster, I will make a @NUM1 link long paper chain . @CAPS8 day or @NUM1 days she ripped one link off. She ripped @CAPS9 then @CAPS10 and even @CAPS11 years. Before she knew it, it was @DATE1 the first. @CAPS7 spang out of bed, ripped last link off and said, @CAPS1 can I have a puppy yet I was patient.  @CAPS13 you see , said her @CAPS1. Your dad and I have been thinking and it is a big responsibility so @CAPS4 next @DATE1.  @CAPS14 Ill be patient.	19
18373	One day I was looking at a catalog in a store, and saw a goalkeeper shirt that I really wanted. So I went to my mom and showed her what I wanted. She said it was a bit pricy, but that she would get it. The next week was very long, waiting for the shirt. On @DATE1 it came, pale yellow, red, blue, and purple. I finally had a goalkeeper jersey to wear to games and make great saves.	14
17844	I think patience is a time when you have to be calm. It is also a time of wateing. For some people being patient is extremely hard. But for me its easy. At times I can be inpatient, but everyone can be. Being patient is kinda new racking, but I manage. A lot of times I get mad if I have to be too patient. I think @PERCENT1 of people in the world dont like to be patient. with patience comes a reward is you are really patient!	10
18401	One time I was patient when we were going to @LOCATION1 for one of my baseball tournaments. It is like a @NUM1 hour drive threw @LOCATION2 and that is the way we went, I was sitting in the back of the car and I had an ear ake so my ear was hearting and I had to wait @NUM1 hours. Another reason is my little brother @PERSON1 was trying to grab my feet, and take his stuffed animal and hitting me with it. I would tell him to stop and he would not so eventully I took the stuffed animal and he would yell at me to give it back so I would. The last reason is we had to wait @NUM3 minutes in a line so we could get back into the @LOCATION3 from @LOCATION2. Then when we were at the front of the line a guy asked my mom question and he asked my two brothers and I who the two people were in the front seat and we said are mom and dad. He asked that to make sure we were not being kidnapped. Those are all reasons why I had to be patient on are @NUM1 hour drive to @ORGANIZATION1 town.	18
17966	One time when my family went to @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, we had to wait in line for the one roller causter I sayed witch one it was. Well I wasnt as patient as my sister, but I was pretty patient. After the ride I had forgotten how long it took to get to go on the ride. My parents remember they thought we had left the park and drove off to somewhere. Well there are many other times I have been patient like the time my friend took two days to put music on my @CAPS2.  She had just gotten her @CAPS2 touch and she wanted to put music on it. So she asked me if I wanted more music on my @CAPS2 too. Well I said yes. Even though I know I cant spend a day without using or just looking at my @CAPS2. But the only thing I could do was be patient. Ok after two days she finally gave it back. I thanked her and asked what took so long. She said that the composer was taking forever and her infer were on it like forever.	18
18386	"@CAPS12's the @CAPS1 of the ninth winning @CAPS2 @CAPS3 up to @CAPS4 full count, @CAPS5 loaded, two out. As the pitcher hurles a @NUM1 fast ball right down the center, @CAPS2 swong and hit his very first grand slam. The crowd exsploded, and @CAPS7 as we were about to leave The anoncer said dont forget kits to day and today only down on the field the @CAPS8 are singing atographs"". I beged and pleaded my dad to let the stay, @CAPS9 @CAPS14 agreed. @CAPS10 the time I got down there these was a huge line. As time slowly ticked @CAPS10 minutes seaming like hours. I could see kids geting ancie. I would have to @CAPS11 my dad had not said ""The only way we ran stay is @CAPS11 you are pertiant "". @CAPS12 took forever, all you had to do was look around and you would see kids going nuts The little ones were crying. I could tell I was maby one of the last five people Being patient, even my dad was getting frustcated  @CAPS12 took at least two and a @CAPS13 hours to get to the front but @CAPS12 felt like @NUM2 days. I @CAPS14 got the whole trams autograph and I was so happy. I even supriezd myself that day I had no idea that I had @CAPS12 in me to be that patient for two and @CAPS13 hours. On our way home my dad stoped at @CAPS15 and got me a frosty, @CAPS9 said @CAPS12 was for being patient was not so bad @MONTH1 t'll be more patient from now and @CAPS16."""	23
17944	One day alex was bothering be. Ao I decided to be patient. But he kept on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, so I decided to tell him to shut up. So again he didnt listen to me so I told @PERSON2, alex did not stop yet so I said nothing and was going to try to be patient with the @CAPS1. Talks a lot and @PERSON1. And eventually it did work and alex finally stoped. So I was happy. But he (alex) started again so I told him to stop on I would tell the teacher again. So he just shrugged his shoulders and kept right on doing all of the stupid noises. So I told the teachers and said alex you better stop this instinse. So alex you better stoped and began resibling with his pencil all over his peace of paper.	18
18899	Patience! Being patient can get you want and I gonna tell you a story about how I got what I wanted by being patient. It @DATE1; two weeks before my birthday I asked for a male scooter. I was told I was too young for one. Of course I was upset I was furious. I waited a few days, but I didnt get it. I waited another week I still didnt get it. When my birthday came, (@DATE2) I finally got my matai scoot! I was so happy! Thats why people should be patient because you might get what you ask for!	15
19136	Playing hockey is importint to me. I am a goaltender playing for farmington hills. Playing goal takes skill having thick skin and most impotantly being patient. Every game day @CAPS2 dad tells me be cool, calm and colected the three @CAPS1s (as I call it). I step on the ice and wait patiently for the puck to come @CAPS2 way. Once it does I am in action. The pirod ends and I wait patiently. The second pirod is here I stand waiting  the drop of the puck hopeing we scare. @CAPS3!!! @CAPS3!!! @NUM1 to @NUM2 @CAPS2 patientness helped its @NUM1 to @NUM2! The third pirod comes @CAPS3!! Big @CAPS4 by @ORGANIZATION1 (thats me)! @CAPS3!! Goooaaalll!! @NUM5 to @NUM2. thats it the game is over! I wated patiently to get that win aganst the @LOCATION1. After the game we all go and party at @CAPS5 @CAPS6s house to celebrate a big win. And we all had a really great time doing it too.	19
18859	Patience is something or someone who like waiting for someone or something patience part of life I sometime dont have patience but I should have patience without patience you will get not because something in lift you have to want for and that is why you should have patience.	6
18535	I remember when I wanted to ride my dirt bike and my dad was busy and I waited till he had time to put gas in it. When @PERSON1 wanted to ask a question he had, but he had to wait and then asked the question	10

So my dad and his friend put me in the truck and we went to @ORGANIZATION1 a hospitly in @LOCATION1. They hade me sitting in a hospitle bed for @NUM1 hours. Then I got shiped to hurly.

18529	There are some ?? ??? in ??? ??? you ??? ??? to second and one of those thing is a patience. Patience is when you understand things and tolerate and when you experience thing that not ??? complain that when patience is.You have to have patience if you planning on having kids or being  I cather or any other job you have to wait in ??? ??? ??? ??? ???? ???? ???? ??? ??? ???.Those are a just a couple reason why ??? patience.The final reason that am going to say you need patience is because in life everything  is not just ??? to you.You have to work for it and to that you have to have patience.So no matter what if you dont have patience you will have  a really hard time getting through life.So thse are all the reasons I think that you need to have patience.So if you dont have patience learn to be patient.I believe that you can do it all you have to do is try to be more understanding of things and dont complain about ??? that hard in life there is going to be a lot of hard things in life.Theres only one more thing I have to say and that is just try.	10
18916	Sometimes I done show patience and sometimes I Do. Being patience is being @CAPS1, @CAPS2, And @CAPS3 the good charater traits that a leader has. Without patience youll @CAPS5 up at every thing hard you Do. So be leader, a person who @CAPS4t @CAPS5 up.Be a person who you love in addition be every thinG you can be. Remember, patience is every thing.	10

But the line was humungus. I was the only one who got to go on the @ORGANIZATION3. Because I stade in line to go on the @ORGANIZATION3. My family cept going on diffrent rides title the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 rid and the @CAPS3 or even the @ORGANIZATION1. While I stood in line at the @ORGANIZATION3 @ORGANIZATION3 fares wheel and the fun house later is that very same day I got to go to the star in @ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2 and wated in the humongus line at the cash register and by the time I had got up to the cash register my family was getting massages. was pachent at @ORGANIZATION2.	13
18504	Patience is sometimes hard to do if you are already exsited. But some time you are doing like if one of your family members is talking & you are waiting for something else that is patience	5
18919	@CAPS6 was @NUM1 at night, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and I was sooo anxious to know what I had gotten for @CAPS1 the next day. I couldnât go to sleep at all, because I was so excited for that awesome day to get my presents and celebrate @CAPS1. I love @CAPS1 because of all of the joy, fun, and happiness in everyoneâs sprit @CAPS6 is very rewarding and good to wait for things because if you wait, then good things will come to you and those around you.sometimes I already know some of the things I had gotten (because my mum is a bad hider)  for @CAPS1 I am patient with others others  because I would like for them to be patient with me as well. Treat others how you would like to be treated. I think @CAPS1 is the most joyful time of the year, donât you? @CAPS6 is fun to fellowship with pets, friends, and family because you become closer well, that is my patience response. Thank you for your time @CAPS9	13
19285	One time I got in trouble for getting a @CAPS1 on my report card and my mom said I was grounded. I asked her how long I would be grounded. So I went up stairs to read a book. A hour later I came down and asked. How long am I grounded? She said I dont know how meny times do I have to ask you to tell. Sow I was buging her all day. She said I am running out of patients. I said can you just tell me she said okay. She pulled out a sheet of papper. I said what is that? She said I counted how many times you asked me. Twelve times yikes! My said twelve days and that is final, I said okay. I think I lerend a lesson today? Dont bug your mom all day and do better in school!	18
18175	I was on my way to tennisee with my @CAPS1, @CAPS2, my younger brother, @PERSON1 and my granpa, and granma, who I call @LOCATION1 and @ORGANIZATION1. @CAPS6 where driving in to different cars I was with @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 in @CAPS1 white mersadies. @PERSON1 was with @ORGANIZATION1 and @LOCATION1 in @LOCATION1s gold minny van. The windows were down in our car, and @CAPS1 and I were smelling burning rubber. @CAPS6 were in front of @LOCATION1, as @CAPS6 slowed down @LOCATION1 pulled to the side of us and told us to pull over. @CAPS6 pulled over @CAPS2 got out took one bok, and said @CAPS6re leaking trannie fluid. @CAPS6 drove into town with @LOCATION1 following us. @CAPS6 stopped at an autin shop @CAPS6 were the only people there, the mucanic told us to get everything @CAPS6 needed out of the car. After @CAPS6 cleaned the car out, he pulled the car up onto thue lift and that when I saw the gradge for the first time. It smelled like gas everything was greasy and dirty (including the mucanics). @CAPS7 is going to ruein our trip I said to @CAPS2, @CAPS6 dont know that for sure he replied. It was so hard to sit and be patient. I walked back and forth between the minny van and the gradge for about two hours. Some of the other mocanics came, too, but no one could find out what was wronge with our car. @CAPS2 got on the computer they had there and looked up car parts, it didnt help. The day before @CAPS6 left @CAPS1 had taken her car to @CAPS10 gardge for a tune up. @CAPS6 werent sure. After sitting at the shop for about three hours I got hungry, so did every one else so @CAPS6 went to a restorunt across the street for loneh. @CAPS2 stay at the shop for a little while longer than the rest of us. At lunch @CAPS2 said were going to have to call triple A to come pick up our car. @CAPS6 are going to have to go back home!! I was so upset, after all @CAPS7 waiting @CAPS6 have to go back home. On the way out of the restorant tripped and landed on my rist. I sprained my rist, so @CAPS6 went back across the street and behind the audio shop was a wallmart so @CAPS6 stopped there got a bandage for my wrist, and pick out a book to buy. I got the vampire diaries, @PERSON1 got a starwars book. @CAPS6 read them on the wag home in @CAPS12 car.	22
18312	Being patient means that your understanding and tolerant, I have been patient too. When I went fishing I have never caught a fish before. I would sit there and do nothing. Not complaining , not saying anything as others around me caught many fish. I felt like a stupid person but I would sit there and just see as other people caught more fish than I did. As I got older it was still the same. I felt like shooting myself when ever some one caught another fish. I loathed every time a person caught a fish but I was patient. My dad always said I was going to catch a fish and I believed him when I turned nine I went to a friends home for a party. He lived by a lake. Every body except my family brought rods and feels. I didnt have any thing to do, so I asked a boy if I could borrow his pole and fish while he was eating. He said yes so I walked to the lake and threw out the line. I saw something bigs tail come out of the water. All of a sudden a tremendous tag on the line almost threw me into the water. A reeled in the line bit by bit so it wouldnt break. Finilly I held the fish high over my head in a triumghant manner and beamed like the sun. I had finally got a reward for being patient all these years.	21
18473	I am going to tell a story in my own way. It was @DATE1. My sister was turning @NUM1 years old. We were at @CAPS1 @CAPS2 setting up for her party. She had a pretty dress and my mom was carling her hair in the bathroom. I walked in and asked my mom if she could curl my hair. She said You have wait. I made a snobby comment and I at one of the tables. I was being patient. Finally, if was my turn. I sat there while she curled my hair. Later that day, my sister, @NUM2 cousins and I all had @NUM3 @CAPS2 to ourselves. I was last on the bowling list @CAPS3 I had to be patient for awile. It was finally my turn. I bowled and I waited. Bowled and water. Finally it was time for cake and I had to be patient again. Eventually I got my cake but I was sick of waiting for everything. While my sister was opening her presents, I was thinking to myself, shes @CAPS3 slow, @CAPS3 I walked up there and shouted, @CAPS4 up! I got yelled at and had to sit out for a while. I should of be patient the whole day and maybe I would of participated in all the games. Thats my story I told in my own way.	24
18344	This is the time when I was patient about going to the doctor. It was a two days before I had to the doctor. My mom had told me I needed three shots, I never liked shots because they hurt and make you fill sleepy. I usally never have patients but this time I did. I had one more day and then I will be at the doctor. I experience why people should have patient and its easy to do. Today was my doctors appointment and I was scared. When I walked in the clinic I always fill sick and tired.  My mom will go sign my name in and I fill more sicker because I will worry about how many shots I will have to get. My doctor had call me and I was terrified my mom always told me that it dont hurt if  you dont look at it. So I went back to the doctor office and my doctor told me to get on the scale, I was really he gave me an hearing test and a eye test. I asked if I have to get any shots he said not yet but I might have to. When I got finish with my hearing test, I was finish and I was scared for nothing. When I got home I had learn two lessons one was not to worry about anything and I learn how to have patients. This is when I was patient about going to the doctor.	16
17992	To me when some one is being patient they are in line or waiting for something and they're being very calm. Where they aren't rushed and are very quiet.	7
17867	I am not a patient person at all. But sometimes I have to be like my birthday for instance, I would love it if my birthday came at least every month. But of course, I only have @NUM1 birthday a year, so I have to wait. I would like to be a patient person. Its just not in the cards for me. My father on the other hand is more patient than anyone. I know he will tell me to clean the car @DATE1 I told him I didnt do it yet so he says he will give me more time. I couldnt be that patient with my kids. I would tell them to clean it now or they would be grounded. I wouldnt force them to or anything but Im not gonna wait a whole month before I get my car cleaned! I guess I could try to be as patient with my father but that would be really hard. Although if Im patient, Im sure I will be able to do it!	16
18971	Patience is??? our or waiting???Patience is dealing with teachers at school and trying to understand their point of view.

18499	Tap, tap, tap. The tips of my fingers bounced of the arm rest with every one movement. I had asked my @CAPS1 to hurry up @CAPS2 I wouldnt be late. I had told her like I have a million times before, @CAPS1, you know how much being on time for practice means to me. @CAPS2 I sat there slummped over on the couch, my backpack strapped tightly over my shoulders. This happens @CAPS7 the time, I thought my @CAPS1 would have learned by now. As I waited, I turned on the television to keep me busy. Unfortunatly, with every flip, I became more irretated. @CAPS3 is she? Why is she taking @CAPS2 long? @CAPS4 like these swirled in my head. Then, my @CAPS1 came stumbling into the family room. She snatched her keys and we hurried into the car. As I snapped my seat belt into place, I flipped the switch to open the garage. As I sat in my seat, wiggling, the garage door crecked open. My @CAPS1 started the engine and we cascaded down the driveway and towards the road. Just to make my luck even better, we got caught in traffic. As the cars sauntered along, time was ticking away. The clock showed @NUM1, I for sure new that I wasnt going to make it on time. I threw myself back into the seat. I closed my @NUM2 and took deep breathes. Taking lots of deep breathes helped slow down my heart rate which allowed me to tone down my stress level. @CAPS5 passient. I told myself. @CAPS5 passient. Relax, youll make it there. @CAPS7 of a sudden my @CAPS1 slammed onto the brakes. My eyes flew open to see that we had made it to the pool. The time read @NUM3. I was going to make it! I exploded out of the car with my bag on my back. At that moment, I told myself see you can do it. You made it to swim practice, and @CAPS7 you had to do was slow down and @CAPS5 passient. Great job	24
18418	Paitience is when you are calmly waiting for something, someone or for something to happen. When I was little I went to the doctor to get a shot, but momdid not tell me it was for a shot, so I was thinking I was I was just going to go in and come out with a sucker. I had asked my mom when I could have a sucker and she said wait a little while be paitient. I went into the room and got the shot and got my sucker. I was angry with my mom because she knows I hate needles.	18
18303	@NUM1 @CAPS1 ago a kid named @CAPS2 was having a problem. This problem is something he would like to keep to himself. He felt like this problem was going to end him. His problem was that he had to go to the dentist!!!@CAPS2 hated the fact that they drill into your teeth. He also hates the smell of dentist office. @CAPS2 had to go in three days and he was even more scared because he's going by himself this time. He then realized that he can't be such a baby so he desited to be patient. He easily waited throw the whole two day and then the day came. He woke up and he road his bike down to the dentists and then he wait a short period of time before he had to go back to the room wear the dentist give you your check up. He desited to close his eyes and be patient. After it was over he went home and was relieft  patients was there.	18
18622	This is my story about patience. I go to the doctors every @NUM1 months. Me, my brothers and my sister and it takes about @NUM2 to @NUM3 hours. When the doctor ask my brothers questions when he says then I am already coming up with my answer and then its my turn, but before my turn @NUM4 sce the doctor I was ireally patient. Then it took the doctor @NUM5 minutes for my turn to be done and over with. Then he has to talk to my mom that comes my time with lls. When we do to the doctor or dentist we and really patient but it takes time for the doctor or dentist to do what they need to do.	11
19086	It was @DATE1 and I could see the snow pouring down as I drank hot chocolate. I saw our @DATE1 tree is was full of presents, I couldnt wait till I could open them. Ive been wanting a wii since @DATE1 but I never got one. But that didnt stop me from hoping. So I wish I got one this year. After a while my parents said @CAPS2 can open our gifts. @CAPS1 I screamed, I quickly tore the paper off the presents and saw that I got a makeup set, a digital camera, and many more. But not a wii. I was frustrated. So I asked my mom if @CAPS2 could buy the wii tomorrow. But she replied @CAPS2 cant afford it. @CAPS2 will buy it when @CAPS2 get enough money. Well I was very patient so I guess I could wait. As @CAPS2 all enjoyed our @DATE1 @CAPS2 watched tv. Then after a week or so my parents got their paycheck, so my mom said @CAPS2 could go out and buy the wii. @CAPS3 thank you mom I screamed. When @CAPS2 arrived at the?? I got the wii and it ??, which was @MONEY1. I couldnt believe it, my patient finally paid off. Now I got my new wii, and @CAPS4 enjoying every second of it.	24

18060	One thime i was in the doctors office and there was alot of people there and I was just getting there and my dad was telling me we should go because there are so many people and I said lets be puctiont and wait and he did so person after person and my dad was pactiont so it was @NUM1: hours till they caled are name and we went in and I got my five and vaxsene shots and we left and we went home and ate diner we not taco saled for dinner.	8
18786	Today was the final day of tryouts. The deciding day .Tryouts we over I patiently waited for the @CAPS2 to hand out the envelopes to all @NUM1 girls. I didnt know if could handle this. @CAPS1 until youve left the building to open your envelope, @CAPS2 @PERSON1 said. @CAPS3s only fair .If everyone opens them in here then people who dont make the team will be sad and bummed while the girls who did would be jumping for joy, which would make the girls who didnt make @CAPS3 feel even more bummed and left out .Be patient and @CAPS1 until you leave the building. she called my name .I came up and grabbed my envelope .She dismissed us .some girls opened their envelopes right away .But, they didnt make @CAPS3 .karma .I waited until I got outside. I could barely @CAPS1 .I needed to know but I had to @CAPS1 .Patience isnt such a lovely thing always. l opened my envelope. I made the team! I was so excited and I was glad I had the patience to @CAPS1 and be surprised.	23
18877	When I went to the @CAPS1 conly @ORGANIZATION2 for youth group at my church I took some o my friend. In the maze we had to go as a group of @CAPS2 & me, my dad, @PERSON1, & @CAPS3 went in one group @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS4 in the group be hind us. Half way thru the @CAPS5 @ORGANIZATION2 there was a guy casing us with a chain saw & then @PERSON1 smacked my glass of my face so we had to stop that @ORGANIZATION2 of the @ORGANIZATION2 so we could find them & just before we found them my friends in the @CAPS6 group came & had to wait @NUM1 minutes wich seemed long. So they didnt get chance to get chaced by the guy with the chainsaw.	17
17881	Patience what is it really? Do any of us have it? I think if we think about it we could all be patient. One time when I was in @LOCATION1 we went to @ORGANIZATION1 and we rod no wait for any of the rides. The next time we went there we had to be patient because the lines were really long. I could wait but it seemed like a lot of the little kids had a hard time standing still. Another example about patences is when the miners got stated in the mine in @LOCATION2 for @NUM1 days they had to be patient and wait for someone to rescue them. They also had to be patient when the were coming up from the mine in that little elevator thingy magig. One last example on patence is when you are walking in a group with other people you have to be patient and listen to there ideas and let them do some of the work. These I think are just some examples of why you have to be patient or when you have to be patient.	12
17931	Being patient as a kid is never really easy. I know lur lne being patient is like taking a baby's lollipop away from mom il just not pretty. But one time l really had to use my patience. Now it wasn't easy at all waiting in line at kings' island @NUM1 hours just to go on illegible. Socio. We waited about another @NUM2 minutes maybe @NUM3 minutes and yes! It started working again. So many people had left us was nicor because me line shortned some, but it was still probably going to be a long wait. It was nice when we got in the building because it was nice and air-conditioned. We sat around warning and waiting debating on wheiner or not. We wanted to stay or leave we ended up staying and waiting for which seemed like forever! Until we stepped into the space snottle. There was another room we had to go through to get to the ride. Finally. The out was over! Using my patience and waiting inline forever really payed off in the end. It was a great ride.	24
18150	One @DATE1 @TIME1 I was very patient when I was waiting for my sister in law to tell my brother to tell us we could come in the hospital room and see their brand new baby @CAPS1. My father and mother were waiting with my sister, bother and I, in the waiting room / lobby. At the time it was probably for an hour and a half waiting. I guess that I could say that I was being patient. Also very ten to fifteen minutes I would have to get up and walk around. I was so shaky nervous and jumpy. But it probably didn't help that I drank three cans of pepsi and right before rushed to the time I was being patient.	14
19479	Once upon a time there was a boy name @PERSON1. Hawell he was right and he was at the secretary of state and he ?? patient so he walked in and took a number and got his paper from the woman. At the front desk to ??? and ??? ??? and started ??? it out in got out and this only on @NUM1 she counting slow so hes getting angry!! And time ?? by and ???  its on ?? and theres ?? in  front of him and leave to go get there ??? secretary card and the person in front of him is up the lady behind the desk opened up and call @PERSON1 and he greeted her with a ??? she took this picture and he got his licence then ends	14
18841	About three or four times I was patience; it was when I was five and it was my birthday and my grandmother when shopping for me I had to be patience and wait for her to come back with my presents. The other time was when I was @NUM1 and it was @CAPS1 day and I was up super early and ready to be to patience, once again and wait for my dad to wake up so I can open my presents. Then the  other time was when my friend had to do something so I had to be patince again so ,I waited till he got back. This will conclude my being patince paper .	15
17856	The time that I was patient was not long ago. It was a day of boredom and waiting. I went to a candy store to buy some candy, I wanted a lorry pop. The man told me to hold on when he was getting my candy. It was @NUM1 minutes until he brought me my candy. I was patient enough to wait for my candy. There was another day like that. It was at the cernical, I was at the end of the line waiting to get on a ride. There was a man who was arguing at the life gaurd instructer for not letting him on the ride. He was arguing for an half an hour. S was patient waiting for him to stop. I did not complane or argue about the man who was wasting our time.	14
19504	My story is about a time when I was patient was in (@DATE1). I was waiting for @CAPS1 to come. I was being patient because we were going to @LOCATION2. I couldnt wait to go but I remembered to be patient.  The less I thought about it the faster time passed by. Then it came, it was time to head to @LOCATION2 when were in the car on our way there I couldnt wait any longer! More and more roads passed by. We passed city to city; state to state. It was the next day already and I still couldnt wait. During the long ride I fell asleep when I had woke up, we were already there.  I had to nare patience because riding in a car from @LOCATION1 to @LOCATION2 is a long drive. While being patient I got to see many things and travelled through different states.	16
19152	It was @DATE1, @CAPS1 my friends were talking about how cool xbox was. They were saying how if you get xbox live then you can play with people around the world. They were also talking about the new game that was about to come out, that was called @CAPS2 of @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @NUM1. I had searched it up online. And it was voted to be a ranking of @NUM2 stars. Now thats a good game. I had asked my mom and my dad if I could get it. They both and always say will see. After another month I had asked my mom again and she said why dont you wait till @CAPS6. And once I went to my dads house he said @CAPS6 is just around the corner. But I said that everyone has it cant I just get it now. My dad said no, so then after that I had waited @NUM1 months thinking could he have his answer or maybe he changed his answer. And again he said no. So I went to my moms house and asked her she said that I should be able to wait and she also said if I ask again I wont get it. And so @CAPS6 came and for my last present from my mom and my dad I had gotten an xbox with my favorite game I was sooo happy. And know I know if you have pacience and you wait long enough youll get what you want.	18
19506	Sometimes on days when I have @CAPS1 patience at @CAPS2, I have to control myself so I dont just go off on someone or totally say something mean to them! Like @DATE1 actually we are going camping up in @LOCATION2. We always go for about a one to two hour hike. And when  we do we go to lake @LOCATION1 but just before that to get there we take an adventure hike, so my dad calls it! It takes you through the woods and over or even through the river. But there is two ways you could take; a five minute hike straight to lake @LOCATION1, or an hour to two hour hike through the woods and over logs. And on days when I have @CAPS1 patience at @CAPS2, and just want to get straight to lake @LOCATION1 we always have to go the long way around! And everybody hates the by the time we get to the lake, because I will just complain and complain some more! (@CAPS3 sometimes I get annoyed at myself!) @CAPS4 on the way back its more fun after we go swimming in the @CAPS5 cold water! (@CAPS3 my dad says it clears my head! But it really doesnt!) And by the time we get back, we are ready to have dinner, but dinner isnt ready yet. @CAPS4 I get to be in a bad mood again! And have to wait some more!	20
18022	Has your parents or you ever sent an application for a job? Well my uncle did and was very patient about it. He wanted that job more than a kid wanted ice cream. One day my uncle typed up an application for the job he wanted. When he was done he copied and paste it for an email. When he pressed send he hurried and grabbed his phone hoping for the job. He looked at his phone right when he got up making sure there were no missed calls or messages. He knew he had to be patient. He was still waiting for the call @CAPS2 still nothing. It was one week and he was thinking about calling the place @CAPS2 he didnt. Then he got a phone call that afternoon so he quickly ran like a cheetah to get his phone. I was just my mom asking if he got the job @CAPS2 all he said was no with a sigh. I felt bad for the poor guy for not knowing yet until one day. The next morning he got a call and he picked it up screaming, @CAPS1 do you want! @CAPS2 not knowing it was the boss for the job. So he apologized and also got the job. He was so happy knowing he waited forever sort of patiently and got the job he wanted. When he went to work at his new job he really loved how he got it and now knew you always knew to be patient and everything will work out great. So now knowing always be patient no matter @CAPS1 the deal is. My uncle @MONTH1 not be an expert @CAPS2 he should be now. Again remember to always be patient and good things will come your way.	18
18133	I forget to grab my helmet and ??? pads out of my moms car cause she works until @NUM1 and at @NUM2 that ??? ??? ???. Then my patience showed up.	13
18265	@DATE1 one, day I was at the store with my sister and my mom thair were people coting, runing in each other and yelling âget out of my wayâ. That made me mad and every one else but like every one else I was not yelling at the overwellmed people. It was almost christmas I seen why every one was geting so mad. We were all trying to just mind are own bussnie. But for some reson people dust made everyone else mad so thatâs when patience came in. After all we got out and when home. Thatâs why you should have patience.	15
19144	I felt a thrill in my body. We were @NUM1 seconds from the opening of @ORGANIZATION1. I had to wait @NUM2 minutes to go on space mountain. I wish I couldve cut all the people in line but I knew I had to wait. When I got off I knew that it was so worth it. A the end of the day I beged to go on one more ride. Again I had to wait @NUM3 minutes to go on. The ride showed boring history of @CAPS1. Then at the end it gave us a screen and we picked the future and showed a funny cartoon with our faces on it.	15
18030	I am normally always patient, but the time I had to be the most patient was when I baby sat @DATE1. I was babysitting with older cousin @PERSON2. We were babysitting twin four-months old baby girls for eight hours! Let me tell you babies are a lot of work and you need a lot of patience with them. One time during the day that you needed to be patient with them was when they cried. These babies cries a lot and for a long time so it took a while to calm them down. Like when I sat one twin down it fell asleep, it would start screaming and I used patience to take time and calm them down. Another event during that day that I used patient was to fell them asleep. The baby I mainly took care of took a while to fall asleep. So I was patient while walking around the house and bouncing her up and down it my arms. Of course, eventually they both fell asleep. A third time I used patience was feeding them. See they were very small twins, so they took a long time to eat. Also when I fed the baby I took care of, natalic, I had to use patience to not freak out when she spit up all over my shirt. @PERSON2, my cousin also used her patience when her baby, @PERSON3, spit up on her too. That day took a lot of patience, but it was still very fun: and you can see that @LOCATION2 and @PERSON1 were lots of work, but patience definitely got me and @LOCATION1, through it.	21
18433	The time I needed patience. We were on the groccery store, @CAPS1 man to be exact.m When we first got there I was exited because we were going to get lots of junk bad, but ther. We started to get lots of food and it looked really good. I started to just eat it all. The cart was half way. ??? @CAPS7 we got more stuff and it was @CAPS3 full that we had to get another cart and it started to get hungry. But the time we were in the meat section, I was starving. My mom said @CAPS2 me just get a couple one things. @CAPS3 I waited, and waited @CAPS7 she told me to go to checkout. All of them were @CAPS3 long and I felt like I was ???(@CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6) @CAPS7 this little girl walked up to me getting smart I couldnt take it, I was about to talk that little girl down. But I had to calm myself @CAPS3, @CAPS7 I realized it was our turn and I was @CAPS3 happy. @CAPS7 when I got home mom cooked bacos and I was just ready to go to bed.	19
18991	This story is about a time when I was patient. I was about @NUM1 years old. It was a gorgeous day outside. The best part is that it was my birthday. All of a sudden I had a brainstorm. I was going to try and ride my bike with no training wheels. So I ran inside as fast as my little feet would let @CAPS9 go. I went @CAPS1 through the front door and I yelled @CAPS2, @CAPS3 @CAPS7 quickly I have something to tell you. @CAPS4 is of buddy my @CAPS2 screeched as she ran down the stairs. @CAPS5 is @CAPS3 I yelled. @CAPS6 is coming. @CAPS7 on sweety you have gotta somewhere @CAPS4 your son wants us to here it must be important. it is, it is, it is, @CAPS7 on mum we can meet him outside. @CAPS8, we will be outside ok @CAPS7 on lets go. @CAPS9 and my @CAPS2 ran outside to wait for @CAPS3 and that was a time that I was patient.	17
19484	When I went to the game with @LOCATION1, @PERSON1, and his mom, and dad. @PERSON1 has downs syndromd. And he likes to wach games. He likes to cheer them on whene their playing. He also like to give them hi fives after they are done playing. I did not laugh at him. I thought was a perty cool guy. He like to talk a lot about suff like sports are cartoons. I dident make fon of him win he talks. I dident win he walks and or win he make nosies that are funny. He think of every one as his filend wich they are. When he standing in line he dosent move vary much. He yells wen @DATE1 port has the ball and is heading for a tuch down. When he gets mad when spirg port, dont have the ball and they score. I @CAPS1 him That we will get it @CAPS2. He say yeha I now that. So he likes to go on to the feeld to wach. But they wont let on the feeld yet so I @CAPS1 him to be patience so he will calm down. When the games over his mom takes us to @LOCATION1 house. We sat in the @CAPS2 being roud and taking. But she did not get mad.even now we had to set in a hour traffic jame. So after all that what I think patience is.	17
18126	I saw someone @CAPS1 patient the got to a rest runt before I did and den I orderd my food and it came. They done sill had no food so I left and finally they got the food now thats what I call patiants.	6
18498	One day during the @DATE1 my phone rang. Not many people call my cell phone. I dashed to my room, but my phone was no where in sight! Oh where is it? I swear, I was about to completely tear down every thing. I stopped I felt my back pocket and there it was. I felt like such an idiot. I was freaking out over my phone because I couldn't find it. When it turned out to be in my back pocket. Any way, it was still ringing. I looked at the contact. I was stuned to see who it was. It was my friend @CAPS1! I answered the phone and @CAPS1 starts to speak. She wanted to know if we can have a sleepover in her back yard. I was so excited, but that same day my family and I were going to a fair. When I asked my dad and he hasitated to say yes. I packed my bags, hoped in the car and ready to go. I really didn't want to go to this peach fair thing. I just wanted to hang with @CAPS1. Here we are at the fair. I got out the car. My brother and I just wandered off. We whent on a few rides, played a few games. All I was thinking about was how much fun I was going to have at @CAPS4. I was waiting and wating and waiting. Finally! Yes we can go. Off to @CAPS4. I couldn't wait any longer. I was so excited: @CAPS6 I 'm at @CAPS4. It's about time. I had no choice but to wait. In conclusion, that was one of the times I was patient.	18
18389	There was a time when I went to @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1. We were driving to @ORGANIZATION1 then there was a long line of traffic so we had to wait. So we waited on a bridge for @NUM1! It was a night more coming true. We got hungry. We really didnt compliments. But we were there for a long time, about @NUM2 we got into the pork. So we were deciding which roller coaster to go on. We decided to go on the @CAPS1. We looked at the line it was a @NUM3 hr wait. We got in line. @PERSON1, @PERSON1, and my brother @PERSON1 were companing a lot. Again it was a nightmare coming true. So my dad and I were fine with the line for the @CAPS2. Actually it didnt take as long as I thought it would. After the wait we got on the roller coaster. We were laughing and scared at the same time. The coaster was over. I was sad. But it was worth the three hour wait. Later that day we rode the @CAPS3 the first ever built standing coaster I was scared again the wait was @NUM4 hours long. And @PERSON1 and my brother @CAPS4 dying from the wait. But the wait only felt like an hour long. I was scared of that coaster. But I loved it. It was a lot of fum to ride roller coasters. We left after a while. It was a long day. The end.	17
17996	The time  I was patience was when I snowbling with my family .Because my dad and I h ave to get them wormed and get them  off the trailar and start them  and he has to ride one around and get us a track and  I ride be hind him on the other sled and I muc to get the snow geon on and that is not ,we go to my aunt and house in @LOCATION1 ,Ive been to a lot of places on the sleds .	11
17997	This is the time when I was patient to my friend @PERSON1. @PERSON1 and me live in the same apartment building, so we hang out all the time. One day I had an @CAPS1 to go to the carnival. I noticed she wasnt liking the @CAPS1 than she said she was scared of rollercoasters, but I told her it wont be a big deal, we will not go on big rides. The day of the carnival, came I was exsited so was @PERSON1, as we got there she was really scared to go on the on therides,so I told her we could go on the smallest ride. After we went oh a few she wasnt scared as much. Than wall, we were walking she saw a ride, one of the bigest rides there, she said we should go on that so than I told her if she wonted to I we could go on it, and she was sure, after that ride we kept going on differnt bigger rides, wall we were walking she said thanks for having patience and that I was a good friend. In summary that was the time I had patience for a friend.	16
18019	One day I had to wait about @NUM1 hours which seemed like a year, but I didnt complain. I sat in the doctors office waiting to get called, I sat there and waited with my mom. I sat and read a magazine while my mom terted her freind. About three people got called in fourty- five minutes. But I sat and looked at the magazine. They called a kid whos name was @PERSON1, and I thought it was me because my names @PERSON2. I finished my magazine and went on to the next one. I thought I would like it because it had war on the front of the cover, but its just a cover nothing cool inside except a floating tranlula trick. About one hour passed and only five people were called. I finnally finished all the magazines and I was bored. I watched people get called and called finnally there were only my mom and I and another group, and of course they got called before us. It was about three hours till we were called, and when we did we had to wait even longer because they had technical difficulties with there machines. When we did get in we had to wait a half and hour for the doctor. But we got in, he made my knee twitch and then made me hop on one foot, why I dont know. But he did the regular put the thing that goes in my ear and the thermometer that goes on my tongue. But we finnally got out and went home. My mom asked me how could I be that patient, and I said, I have not a clue.	20
19181	"What is patient? Being patient means to wait for something that @MONTH1 take a long time but you understand and wait without being rude. An example is your waiting for a toy that just came out. Everyone has it and it's the coolest toy in town. The problem is your mom and dad can't afford it right now. When you understand that moneys fight and you don't start by you moms side begging for the toy everyday your being patient. If you are doing that then you're not being patient and your mom going to say ""stop your being patient. Before you be rude and keep begging for what you want think of other people, understand why it might have longer then you want and be patient."	14
19421	To @CAPS4 being patient means to not while if you ordered something and its taking long to come to you. Thats what kids do. I have been patient many times in my life but just one poped into my mind when I thought of patience. One @TIME1 I woke up at @TIME1 to go take pictures for our passports. @CAPS7 thought @CAPS8 wasnt going to be bush over there. Boys were @CAPS7 wrong. @CAPS7 started to get dressed up. By the time @CAPS7 were done the clock hit @NUM1. @CAPS7 got into the car and @CAPS7 were on our way. @CAPS4 and my little brother cranked up the music and started singing, I @CAPS1 YOUR @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4. My parents got soo annoyed and made us stop singing by turning off the music. mom that our favorite song. @CAPS5 our @CAPS6.PS. Said you have reached your destination. Finally, @CAPS8 was getting a little spiffed up back here. @CAPS7 got into the waiting room, @CAPS5 @CAPS7 all almost faint because of how much people there was. lets just calm down I mean how long will @CAPS8 take for a sudden a deep voice in my head said,  @NUM2 hours later. My brother decided to make a bet with @CAPS4. @CAPS8 you dont crack @CAPS5 its are turn to take the pictures I will do anything for you whenever you want for a week. You have yourself a deal. @CAPS8 took a while for another @NUM3 hours to pass and I was about to scream. I was then falling deeper and a sleep @CAPS5, the @PERSON1 family your next. The man had a long white beard and glasses. @CAPS7 finally went in and got over with @CAPS8. @CAPS10, I win @CAPS11! I won the bet, with a big smile on my face @CAPS12 you have to do anything I want. I was so happy that I started doing my victory dance, while the man with the glasses and beard stared at @CAPS4 like I was a maniac. @CAPS7 took our picture and @CAPS7 were off. Patient means to wait and wait without whining. Everyone has to be patient in there  life just like @CAPS4	23
19315	I am going to write a story about patience. Patience is when you wait for somebody to do something. One example of this might be if someone else is fixing something for you and you really waited them to be finished so you can move on with your life, but it is the type of thing that takes time, maybe a lot of time, but if you want it done right, you will have to wait. Sometimes it will not be a person you wait for, but an inamate object, like a television show, which can not be rushed, even though sometimes you want to ruch it. With a human however, if you rush them to do something, (which can happen it @MONTH1 end up being not as good and even breaking in about ten seconds after them doing it, it @MONTH1 end up happening faster though. You might also waight for nature too, such as a sunny day. When it @MONTH1 have been raining for over a week. You also might be waiting for the power to come back on during storm. It, for me, have really wanted the power to come back on during a storm because there is nothing to do!!! Patience is also about waiting for your ??? like when you are bored.	12
17894	A time I was patient is when my little brother kept messing with me. He kept doing dump stuff like pulling the curtins down or playing with the stove. I wanted to hit him. I didnt hit him because he was just being bad.	13
19158	A time when I was patient was when I was waiting at the dentist for my brother. My brother name is @CAPS1 and he is sixteen. One day we went to the dentist. My brother had to get his wisdom teeth pulled. My grandma and @CAPS2 waiting for hours. After a while, she went to the backroom with my brother. So I was sitting in the waiting room alone. Thankfully I had my @CAPS3 so I watched a few cartoons and listened to music. A few minutes later I went to the bathroom. When I got out a nurse told me to come with her, she lead me to the backroom with my brother and my grandma. I learned that the doctor didnt even start yet! At least I could talk to my brother. So for what seemed like days the doctor finally showed up. After a hour or so the operation was over. Then we had to sit and wait for the amnesia to wear off. My brother was acting loopy and crazy. It was actually funny. Finally we left and I didnt lose my patience.	18
18981	I was patient when I had to wait in a very long line at leader @CAPS1 amusment park! In @LOCATION1 I had to wait for @NUM1 hours for the ride, The @CAPS2. It went from @CAPS3 to @NUM2 in @CAPS4! When going @NUM2 the coast went strate up then, stoped at the top (@NUM4 yard) we just sat their for like  @NUM5 sec! Then it moved and we went strate down at @NUM6 it was relly cool! It was werth the wait. That was the time I was patient!	13
18939	Patience is, in definition, being understanding and tolerant. I am not patient, I understanding but I am not that tolerant. Some people though, are tolerant and understanding or patient. Here is a story of someone I know who is tolerant. In the @NUM1 grade my math teachers assistant had to be so patient with our because they would ask the same questions over and over again. She would teach the lesson and than have to reteach it before to living questions. I was in the advanced group so we went fast and never really had to ask questions. I could never be as patient as she was teaching those people.	10
19020	When me and my dad were inline for the kencer hauck at @LOCATION1 adventures! I had to wait patiently to get on. The line was massive so many people ??? of us and it was shocking that so many ??? ??? in line for this roller coaster we waited for what seemed like hours was only minutes, and as we got closer it was getting hard to be patient. Finally we got on the ride and it was on the ride and it was insane so waiting for those minutes that seemed like hours ??? rewarded with a ??? ???	16
