6961	In Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting affects the cyclist. The cyclist takes advice from some old guys and ends up wishing he never did. He is on an empty road, flat and dry. He ends up drinking all of the water he has, and needing to stop for some more. I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. He stopped to get more water, but once, all that came out was some tar like stuff, and then he couldnt find another place for quite a white. The flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills and he came to a sigh that said Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit, and passed tumble weeds and a large snake. All of these things impacted his journey with fear, caution, etc. When he finally reached a place to get a drink, he was finally satisfied. Because it was hot, and empty, he was more thirsty so therefore the setting affected the cyclist.	3
7010	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many was. The cyclist had been riding on the high deserts of California in June. The cyclist also saw a ridiculously large snake. There was also no signs of civilization for miles. There was no one insight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. The cyclist went through many different obsticales travilng, triying to get to Yosemite. I think the settingS affected the cyclist in many ways.	1
6850	Hot, terrain, middle of nowhere- all are features of the setting that affected the cyclist. First, the hot weather in California made the cyclist thirsty and almost dehydrated. There was no place to stop for water and if there was, the water was bad and warm. Second, the different types of terrain made the cyclist really thirsty also and tired. Lastly, the cyclist was in the middle of nowhere. He couldnt get water to hydrate himself or to sit down and rest.	2
6296	The setting was hot and dry, which affected the cyclist greatly. She didnt have enough space to carry a lot of water and rod to make portrons to drink. Also listening to old guys who didnt know much didnt help either and sent her on a much harder path to travel	0
6677	In the essay, Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, the setting had a major impact on the character. The cyclist was trying to get to Yosemite National Park, but on the way, he had some troubles, the fact that there was not much civilization affected the cyclist because he was not able to refill his water bottles, so he grew very thirsty. Also, the many hills and the fact that it is summer impacted him greatly because he became tired out more easily and could not pedal as fast. When it says, A tar like substance oozed out Wouldnt cool down, it showed how he wasnt able to drink. Also, when he passed the grape juice factory, it must have been torture to him since he was so thirsty. If he hadnt taken the advice of the men in the first place he would have had a much shorter ride and would not have been so exhausted. The setting affected the cyclist a lot in this essay.	3
6357	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because he was biking up hills in extreme heat. He also had a short water supplyl while head in the wrong direction.	2
7019	In the essay the features of the setting affected the cyclist. In the begginning the setting was at the old mans place and the cyclist was happy and confident. When he reached the ghost town and was out of water he was upset and frustrated. When he saw the building he was relived but when he found out it was abandoned he was sad. When he finally reached the store he was excited and relived. That is how the setting affected the cyclist during his trip	2
6387	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example he feels dehydrated and tired because he is riding through the desert and has a lack of water. I often feel this way when jogging for extended periods of time. The men in the story who havent left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office also add to the story. Due to their role, the cyclist takes an unmarked shortcut that turns out to be horrible. The Welchs factory affects the cyclist because it increases his thirst and causes him to once more think about it. The sign showing grape juice looks irrisistable to him and drives him to keep forward in search of anything to drink. The terrain charge also affects the cyclist because it causes him to have to work ever harder to get up hills now rather than just ride flat terrain.	3
6566	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many was. First, the town The cyclist first comes upon is described as a ghost town. Although the cyclist chuckles about it, this setting sets up the long journey the cyclist has a head of him. There were other features that would negatively affect the cyclist. For example, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. (pg @NUM1). Flat land is much easier for a cyclist to pedal on. The change from flat land to hills affected his stamena and will to keep going. He really had to push himself to trudge up and down each hill. His determination finally led him to, Gary and Wilbers Fish camp (pg @NUM2). He finally found hope.   	3
7441	Seting is one of the most important neds for a cyclist if the terrein or weather are bad, the hotter it is for a cylist its ?? ??	1
6908	The setting was the main affect on the cyclist. He said it was hot and that he was lost. The cyclist had no clue were he was going and it was hot out side. He seemed very strest and that only made it worse for him. He was thirsty from all riding and the heat so he trys to get water from a water pump. The water that was in it was horable. He called it a substance it had a flavor of battery acid. If he were not lost and if it were cool outside he would have water and he would not be so upset. The setting of a hot and lost place had a huge impact on the cyclist.     	2
7627	In the essay Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed Speed limit this many different settings took its toll on the cyclist. For example in the beginning he started out with a nice smooth ride. But it was very hot. Then he began to get into a hort rolling hills which were taking thier toll on his legs. Then we entered into a rough are where he had to be more careful. The roughness prolly wore him out from all the bumps and bounces. He went through a lot on that bike trip, who know he @MONTH1 have never made at back to where he was staying.	1
6711	The setting affects the cyclist in many ways. First, he couldnt get water from anywhere because he was in a dessert with nothing but ramshackle sheds and rusty camps. Second, there were short rolling hills, and rough roads which made it hard to ride on. There were tumbleweeds in his way and large poisons snakes. The heat made it hard to keep riding. And there were no buildings structures of people around to give him a lift or water. That is how the setting affects the cyclist.	2
7101	The setting affected the cyclist because of the mood and how everychange happened. For instance when the setting changed the cyclist felt different and it really affected him. Like if the setting was all sunny in a nice town then he would feel good but if he was in a dark town he wouldnt feel very happy. So the setting really affected him.	1
7671	You came alway choose your features because you idea mind be change over time.	0
7454	Topic: The features of the setting affect the cyclist. The features of the setting affect a cyclist or the major problem that a cyclist encounter are some rough road, inspection of the bike, putting on necessary equipment, do not exceed posted speed limit For a cyclist to be doing all this I don think there is going to be any features of the setting affect a cyclist. For a cyclist to maintaining the speed limit of @NUM1 or a water-depleting @NUM2: sometimes life can feel so cruel. At some point, tumbleweeds are caused by too much of speed but for them to be using the necessary equipment they wont get seriously injured. Forget that old saying about never taking candy from strangers. No, a better piece of advice for the solo cyclist would be Never accept to	1
7430	The feature of the setting affect the cyclist by giving him hope that the finishing line is not far and there was nothing in sight no cars, building or stucture of any kind.	1
7180	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it is so hot the cyclist keeps drink and sweating water so he is really work down from dehydration and fatigue. Also just the feeling of how unsafe it is out there. Like how he saw a ridiculously large snake or how it just keep getting hotter.	1
6025	Some of the features of the setting affect the cyclist like the road was bad it had bumps all over that made it much harder and it also took up a lot of strength. Also the neighborhood of two hundre degrees after that become to a road with arore bunch of hills	1
7225	The features of the setting affect the cyclist b/c the route, that the cyclist was taking there was a rough road him to travel. The cyclist took bad advice from some old men that hadnt left off their porches for decades.  also, as he got into his long journey he began to notice what the advice the old men had given him was bad was bad advice, the cyclist was headed to Yosemite & he had gotten some advice from ???(not legible onwards)	1
6471	The setting affects the cyclist because its very hot outside and he is starting to loose energy. The setting affects how fast he rides when he stops or when he drinks or eats. all of these depend on the type of weather he is riding in. like in the story it was so hot out when he saw a building he wiped the sweat from his face to make sure it wasnt a mirage.	1
7554	The features of the nearby setting affect the cyclist in a bad way. The four main things that affect him are the heat, lack of water, lack of nearby buildings, and @CAPS2. For this cyclist one of the biggest problems is the heat. He says i was travelling through the high deserts of California in June. this shows that it is quite hot outside by the month stated. June is quite a hot month especially in @CAPS1 deserts. The second problem is the cyclist lack of water. He says throughout the story how thirsty he is and how much he needs to drink some water. When he reaches the end, however he finds water. The third problem is when he needs water, he cant find anywhere due to the lack of buildings. He pedals great distances trying to find towns nearby. Once he finds them, they are either ghost towns or are not useful at all. The final problem he faces is the @CAPS2. He says At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. @CAPS2 is getting in his way and not helping him to reach his destination at all. Truly . the features of the nearby setting are affecting him in a tramatizing way, because so many things like heat, lack of water , buildings, and @CAPS2 are inches way.	3
6614	Knew what he was getting himself into so if he needed water or nething like that, it was probly his own falt he should have brought some with him.	1
7253	The features of the setting affect the cycleist by hurting his ability to keep going. In this story the cyclist was faced with many setbacks or problems. At first he took advice from very old man who had out of date directions. Then the cyclist thought he could keep going on a very limited water supply. The cyclist then was getting dehydrated and angry. The cyclist then found an old building which raised his hopes only to drop them once he found out it was closed and rundown. Finally he finds a store and then dehydrates and is on his way again.	1
6810	The features of the setting have a great affect on the desperate travels of the weary cyclist. The sometimes disappoint, sometimes uplifting, scenery he passes affect him physically and emotionally when he passes a portrin the road with nothing but a ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral he becomes disturbed.  The cyclist is running low on water when he becomes even more distraught at a road with a speed limit posted as 55 mph, when he was, doing a water-deleting @NUM1. The setting of the hot, June sun affects the cyclist and puts him in a state of dehydration. In an, ironic twist the cyclist is affected emotionally when he passes a @ORGANIZATION1 factory that has been abandoned. The factory features a picture of a boy pouring a glass of juice into his mouth which upsets the thirsty cyclist.	3
6071	In 'Rough @CAPS1 Ahead' the features of the setting and the cyclists surroundings greatly influence him. Because he is in the high deserts of California in June, the climate is hot, dry, and miserable. Another feature of the setting that affects the cyclist, is that he is out in the middle of nowhere. There are no other human beings, cars or buildings for miles. Also, the terrain affects the biker. When the road starts to get bumpy and uneven, it causes him to exhaust his water supply even faster. Overall, the cyclist in this story is greatly affected by his surroundings.	2
6967	"In the essay Do Not @CAPS1 Posted Speed Limit the setting effects the cyclist in many ways. When the cyclist arrived at the first town, he described it as a ghost town. This effected the cyclist because he started to have doubts about the directions he received, but he was looking foward to the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite so he persevered. The setting of the next land mark was similar to the last. There was a shed, a few rusty pipes and a corral that ""Couldnt hold in the lamest mule. This made the cyclist more werry of the path ahead because he was running out of water. The next place was also similar. There was an abandoned @ORGANIZATION1. The cyclist was running out of water and now thought he was going to die because everything was deserted. Then, finally, the setting changed. There was a store that was actually opened. The cyclist then felt happy and relieved. That is how the different settings effected the cyclist."	3
6540	In the story Do not exceed Posted Speed limit a cyclist takes a journey through terrain to get to Yosemite. In that part of California there are not a lot of towns or people. The rode he is rideing on is very dangerous and long. It is very dry and hot out there but	2
6190	The features of the setting affect the cyclist, because there are no cars, building, water, or people in sight. It goes from flat road to rolling hills. Even though he had no water he was determined to keep pedeling. Rough road Ahead, do not exceed posted speed limit At this point he had no water left and he was pretty much in the middle of nowhere. If I was in his situation I would feel hopeless. There was no sign of hope. He just saw endless rolling hills and that was all. Then when he saw the building over the hills he thought he was home free. So he pedeled up to the building, and that with all the others was abandoned. The cyclist thought he was going to die. In conclusion the features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist because seeing nothing gives him no hope. If he had cars and buildings on both sides of him that probably would have give him some confidence but that was not the case. He is in the middle of nowhere. He finally came to bend and say Then, as easily as randing a bend my troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind me.	2
6448	The setting affected the cyclist greatly. He had no water and he was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. The deserts and no water could have been life-or-death to him, making him stressed and thirsty. Couple that with him biking, and you have yourself a dehydrated man in the desert! When he was between the ghost town and bait shop he says, There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind, This would make the cyclist think that there is no hope for his survival if he passed out. The deserts of California affects any cyclist greatly especially one without water like the cyclist in the story. 	2
6495	The second photograph better communicates ideas similar to the ideas expressed in the essay A sea worry , because the story is about a boy who surfs as a job & in the second picture a boy is surfing. The author says my son body-surfs. He says its his job. That quote was explaining that hes a body-surfer & its his occupation. This is the reason I chose the secod photograph.	2
6450	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because of how hot it is, how big the hill is and the shortage of cold water. For example it is so hot that the cyclist does not think he is going to make it. Also all he could do was a water depleting @NUM1. Also the hills became so big he crested the first couple until the sign jumped out saying rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit. Lastly he had some rough terrain to ride over and no water he was at a dehydrated state and he could only do a water depleting @NUM1 when the speed limit was @NUM3. 	2
6130	The features of the setting keep affecting the cyclist because first its hopeful then he relizes its hopeless. He was laughting when people told him the right directions and now It was sad, hopeless laught, mind you, but at least I still had energy to feel bad for self. said the cyclist when he was refering back to the first town. The reason this affect the cyclist is at first he was going good then he got thirsty and bad things happened.  thats how it affect th cyclist.	1
6552	With age comes wisdom and all that, but the world is a fluid place things change No a better piece of advice for the solo cyclist. Never travel advice home old-timers who haventh confines of use porches.Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills. Rough Road ahead Do not exceed posted speed limit.	1
6532	In the essay Do not exceed posted speed limit by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. First, the sun is making the cyclist hot and dehydrated. He states The sun was beginning to beat down, @CAPS1, the sun was a big factor on the affect on the cyclist. Also, the hills of the country roads. Going up and down hills take alot of work you have to use alot of energy. The cyclist says @CAPS2 were replaced by short, rolling hills. @CAPS3, there were snakes in the road, which make the cyclist timid looking out for snakes so he would not get bit. Againg the cyclist states dimond back-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. @CAPS4, there was an old factory that gave the cyclist hope and then crushed his hopes. The factory even made him more thirsty. @CAPS1, there were many affects on the cyclist due to the setting.	3
7393	The conditions in the California desert were horrible for a cyclist. The temperature was extremely high and the humidity was very dry. The roads also had a lot of hills and when a cyclist has to use his energy in the heat to go up and down hill after hill, it can be very hard. There were also no stops to refill his water a long the way,which is bad because the neat,lack of water,and all of his energy extension leads to major dehydration.The conditions along this trip are not good for a cyclist and can be very dangerous.	2
7485	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit. For example, he finds a ramshackle shed and tries to find water. It affected him, because it says, I got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees. The quote meaning that he was determined to find water and perhaps anything.	1
7077	The setting affects the cyclist because he is faced with roadways he is unsure of the weather is hot and dry and there are wild animals. The text states,	2
6586	When the biker listened to the old folks he had confidence. He biked to the first town but it was like a ghost town. A town is a town. soon after that, he did not see anything. No cars, buildings, or anything. He was getting sad and dehydrated. The old men swore there was a town coming up so he put his trust and confidence in him once again. He saw a building  coming up, but it was just an old wore down factory. He thought he was let down. He was sure he was going to die, right there right now. He than saw a siga for a fish comp! He was overjoyed! The place was real to! He thought of them as his savior! The settings effect the cyclist tremendously.	2
7145	The features of the setting affected the cyclists because he was thirsty and it was hot and he was almost out of water and he almost died because when he was drinking the water and he hit a bump and spit got lodged in his throat and tiring hills it seemed to never end.	1
6015	The features in the story great effect the cyclist. One feature of the setting that effects the cyclist is the heat. At first, the story says that the pine trees cooled the cyclist, but eventually the forest turned into a desert, and the heat poured down on him, make it hard to cycle. Another feature that effected the cyclist was the lack of water. As he moved away from his beginning point, the cyclist was drinking lots of water. But when he needed to refill, the water was brown and hot, so the cyclist didnt take any. The lack of water plus the heat formed one giant obstacle that potentialy could have killed him, but through great determination the cyclist got through this troubling time.	2
6039	In the story Do not exceed posted speed limit by Joe Kurmaskie there were many things that effected the cyclist. Such as the water. He had no really good water to drink because of where he was''. When I tryed a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid''. He wasnt able to drink the water because the battery acid'' that was in it could have made him very sick. Also the unstable roads that he had to bike through made things hard. ''Rough roads ahead'' To ride on unstable ground can be very hard to do. So just these two examples, the water and Rough roads made the features of the setting deffinitly effect the cyclist.	1
6922	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. I say this because the setting is in the hot deserts of @LOCATION1. The cyclist is sweaty and tired and has almost no water left. This lack of water makes the cyclist desperate for food and water. The setting has a lot to do with how the cyclist reacts to what happens.  	1
6886	In the short story, Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, the setting greatly affects the cyclist. For example. In the beginning of the story, the cyclist is eager to get to Yosemite National Park. He listens to the advice of, old-timers who havent left the confines of their parches since carter was in office, and quickly realized that he shouldnt have. The author describes the setting of the first town as, the traditional definition of a ghost town. This didnt bother the cyclist as much as his next sight. One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and corral that couldnt hold in the largest mule. Was what met him there. The cyclist said that this sight was troubling. It is obvious that the cyclist has given up hope when he says, It didnt really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean. This short story shows how anything can get even the best of travellers worried about their survival.	2
6821	When the cycleist mentions how hot and dry and open the terrain is, it makes me feel like he is in the desert. I also know that its hot because he is swreating and dehydrated.	1
6945	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by unexpected things happening. His water supply got drank quickly and he couldnt find a town near. He was in the desert-like California, and the sun was beating down on him. When he did one town, it was more of a ghost town, and had rusted pumps that had battery-oil tasting liquid. Every person he asked told him is near, but from dehydration, it took him longer. the roads got windy and small hills occurred. There was a large snack in the middle of the road, as the tumble weed blew by. the finally saw a town that had a bait shop and was able to get water and cool down.   	2
6399	In the essay the setting affects the cyclist is different ways. For example, the couse must have been tough because he was dehydrated and it says that there are rolling hills and rough roads. Another example is there were dangerous animals like snakes that he came across. In conclusion, these are some reasons how the setting affects the cyclist.	2
6143	"There are a couple things that affect the cyclist in the story. One of the ways he is affected is de hydration. In the story about dehydration it says  The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June. A good affect on the cyclist was no one in sight to slow him down on his bike ride. A bad affect on him  was dont ask direction from a guy from heat strokes on a gorgeous day in June simply because listened to some gentlemen who hadnt been left their porch in decade, caused me to laugh. One more thing that got in his way was the poisonous snake."" At some point, tumble weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously larg snake--It really did look like a diamond back.. Blocked the major of the parement in front of me""."	3
7400	The condition the cyclist are in calls for a lot of preparation. The cyclist was in a hot desert area with winding road and hills. The cyclist need to have plenty of water to make it where he is going, and, as read in the story, the conditions almost caused @CAPS1 health to the man who was trying to ride through.	1
7674	When riding a bike the features around you can affect the cyclist. Some things that can affect the cyclist are weather and scenery. If the weather is cold and rainy the cyclist would not want to be riding. The dangers of riding when the weather conditions are bad will make the cyclist second guest: riding or not. If the weather is extremely hot the cyclist will get dehydrated quicker and even more exhasted. The scenery can also affect the cyclist. When a cyclist is riding and all he/she sees is a desert then they might have doubts on where there going. If there are abandon buildings everywhere the cyclist @MONTH1 become frighten and want to head back of lose hope as shown in the story Do not exceed the speed limit when he gets over a hill and begins to think that he will never make it to Yosemite. Many things can affect the cyclist.	2
6987	The cyclist was affected by long hours of riding the bike into the areas where he never been.	1
6556	The features of the setting will affect the cyclist because the roads are hilly and he is old so it will be hard for him to ride up them. It was very hot and he had a scares supply of water. He was seeing things that wasnt there. When he did try to get some water, the weather was so hot that the water from the pump came out hot.	1
7280	In the story, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, written by the @CAPS1, the setting reflects how the cyclist is feeling. For example, Flat roads was replaced by short, riding hills @CAPS2 as the terrain was changing, so was his attitude. When he first started the journey, he was happy and care free and the land had no hills and he flat. However, once he notice that everything is not has the men said, he seems to grow a little angry and upset, @CAPS2 like the land seemed to reflect this soon he found himself in a bumby and unpleasant road. The setting also seemed to give the man more obstacles to overcome on adventure tumbleweeds crossed my path a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the movement in front as me. The land seemed to be leasing and tormenting him, when he started to figure out that listening to the old men was a mistake.    	3
7197	There are several features of the setting that greatly affect the cyclist. One feature is the desert he is biking through. The heat of a desert in June can easily dehydrate someone. When exposed for a long time, exercising, and running out of water, the effect is even greater. In addition, the change in terrain and road surface would have an effect on the cyclist. Traveling on a flat road requires much less effort then climbing hills. If the road is also rough, the biker has to work even harder to push the up the hill. There is also the mental effort of not tipping the bike on the uneven surface. Finally, there are not any buildings in sight. When someone is dehydrated but has no water, they are desperate to find some. However, if there is nothing they know of nearby, they will start to lose hope. Once they lose hope they wont try as hard to keep going and they will lose some of their strength. Considering all of the things negatively affecting the cyclist, it is amazing that he managed to push through and reach a source of water. 	3
7605	The features of the setting like the dessert the sun and abondered towns affect the cyclist alot. The dry dessert makes him feel as if he were riding forever. And probably makes him wonder if he is ever going to make it to a town. The sun makes hime even  hoter not  he already is makes him sweat more and makes him even more thirsty.The abandoned towns make him lose hope in finding water or even if he is ever doing to make to yosomite. The mood of this story goes from content to sad to happy. He is content after riding to the first town but then the rest of time towns are abandoned too and start to ran out of water an he thinks he is going to die which makes it sad. Then he becomes happy when he finds the bait shop an finds water.	3
6701	During the cyclists biking adventure he encounters several interesting situations. Each experience is in response to the setting in which it takes place. For example, this young man starts out confident with a bright hope of eventually reaching Yosemite National Park. The first spot he comes to is a ghost town This sight doesnt immediately affect him, however it greatly adds on to the long term effects. He decides to continue on his treck reaching the next ghost from at this time he is becoming dehedrated due to his lack of water supply He decides to keep persueing his good and figures there must be water up ahead in the next town. In order to get the next town he must encounter some precarious situations including some changes in terrain. Eventually after reaching a source of running water he is overjoyed with happiness and relief. As evident in the provided text this man was effected by each feature of the setting. The different settings greatly affected his nature of confidence.	3
5987	In the story, Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit written by Joe Kurmaskie, represents how certain conditions can affect a cyclist. The cyclist was biking through the desert to reach Yosemite National Park, but on his journey he accoutered many tough conditions to make it difficult to get there. First of all, the desert was very hot which makes travel very difficult. For example the text states, the sun was beginning to beat down. @CAPS1 makes any task difficult because the sun drains a persons energy. Secondly, the trip was very long so the cyclist had a hard time conserving water. For instance, the man drank so much water, he almost ran out; The water bottle contained only dehydration which can cause death. Joe Kurmaskies story, Rough Road Ahead. Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, represents how certain conditions of an environment can affect a cyclist.  	3
6713	In this pasage the cyclist was affected by the setting because if it had been any were else he would not have suffered or learned at all. Because the seting had botha lack of civillesation and water that he needed that caused him to almost faint of thirst. This is an example of the setting affecting the cyclist, With what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill. This showes that had all the setting been paridice he would never learned anything.	2
7044	The setting affected the cyclist because it was in June and it was starting to get hot. In the book, it said he was going through the desert. Also, the author did not have enough water to survive in the desert while the sun was beaming on him.	1
6464	When the cyclist went to ask about the road the old men told him all its good way that he should go. But the old man hasnt seen the land in a really long time. The man dont long that the land has changed. So when the cyclist went back to ride the roads and everything ends ?? the cyclist didnt know what to do.  	1
6193	The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly. First, is the beating sun. The heat dyhydrates and almost kills him. The rocky road is also a factor. It takes up the time and energy he has to preform. Another key ingreedient of the setting was the desert. There was no one to help him and there wasn't a place to get water. In conclusion the setting was a big factor in the story.	1
6214	Being a cyclist and in the condition he was in would be even worse in the setting he was in, such as the heat of California, and difficult condition of the path he was on. Him being so hot and tired from the difficult hilly trail would be worse with having the lack of supply of water. The author was very dehydrated and was on the verge of fainting. If it were not so hot, the cyclist would have been in a much better condition.	1
6292	During the cyclists trip, he experienced physical and mental strain. The intense heat, rough terrain, the animals and his isolation all contributed to his strain while completing his challenging task. His isolation while cycling down the shortcut was a definite factor in his strain. @PERSON1 stated that,  there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. All @PERSON1 had to focus on was accomplishing his task. There wasnt anybody nearby to help him and there wasnt any shelter for him to take to escape the heat. The heat itself played a very predominant factor in Kurmaskies physical strain. The heat caused him to become dangerously thirsty and required him to find an abundance of water fast. Kurmaskie stated,  the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke This statement proves that the intense temperature was a life threatening factor. The rough terrain and snake and two factors in his trip that just helped make his journey even more cruel. The physical strain of avoiding a snake in the middle of the road and the dangerous terrain just put him in a more grading position. 	3
7015	"In the setting the young man is faced  by some challenges that make him as an individual a stronger person. For example he was proud of himself he mad himself happy by saying at the end ""yes sir! I own a very good map"". He knows that he got through the heat, dry air, snakes, and a low supplie of water to get to where he was determined to be Yosemite."	2
7118	In the essay Rough Road Ahead, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit  the setting affected the cyclist. The setting affected the cyclist mentally and physically, when the setting was nice he had a positive outlook and was full of energy. Later in the essay, as the setting grew less appealing, and more treaterous, the cyclist grew weary and distressed.	1
6900	The conditions and features of the setting caused the cyclist to be tired and dehydrated and think that he was going to die from it. For example, it says and ther growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a georgus day in June. Also , he thinks he is getting dehydrated when he says I  was doing a water depleting 12 mph. sometimes life could be so creul. in conclusion, this cyclist started this without enough water causing him to think that he was going to die from either heatstroke or dehydration.	2
7386	Some features of the setting that affect the cyclist are. The hills that the cyclisit has to go over and the heat. The heat is making the cyclist sweat alot so he is loosing fluids and he starts to got dyhydrated. The hills are making him have to work harder and getting more tired.	1
7043	The setting of the story had affected the bike rider in many way. It was hot when he was riding so he was thirsty. For example, The sun was beginning to heat down (pg @NUM1). So the sun is very exhusting and made him to start dehydrating. Another example is a traveling through the desert of California in June (pg @NUM2). California is a relatively hot state and June is one of its warmer months. The terrain didnt favor in the riders either Flat road had turned into, short rolling hills (pg @NUM2). Short rolling hills are harder on a bikers body than flat terrain. This is how the setting affected the rider.	2
6117	There are many ways the features of the setting affect the cyclist. One feature is the weather. When a cyclist is on a trip the weather could affect the setting greatly. An example, if it started to rain the roads could become very slippery and dangerous to ride your bike on. The cyclist and his bike could crash and die. Just cause of the weather. Another feature is the animals. An animal is important cause any were you do the are different animals that do different things. If the cyclist knows  the animals around the area that he is traveling he could keep safe and not be harmed. Tis better to know the area and feel safe. Then not knowing whats going to happen next.	1
7481	The features of the setting affected the cyclist negitvly because he was in the desert in the summer with little water and no stones too get a drink at, For example he says There was no one in sight not a building, car, or structure of any kind's. This explains how his setting affected him because he had no where to go or get a drink. That is my reason why the cyclist settings where negitve.	1
6863	How the features of the setting affects the cyclist is the condition of the roads, rolling hill, and the?? heat. The conditions of the road in the settings affect the cyclist because the roads are rough. An example firm the texted is  I noticed that terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short ralling hills. These condition make is hard for the cycled it gives him a challenge.  The rolling hills challange him a regret to stay on the road it is easly tricky and challenges so was The heat & sun was also played an affection on the cyclist. An Examples from the @CAPS1 is. I chuckled, checked my water supply and moved on. The sun was beginning to heat doing but I barely not ???. the sun was not starting to get him  ?? sharply ??  It will start to get ????? when is ?? is high deserts. I conclude that these features in the setting affected the cyclist in many ways but he keep pushing himself to more on.  	3
6912	The feature's of the setting affect the cyclist because the condition's he is in without any water. the cyclist would be fine if he would have had more water for his trip. He ran out of water not to for into  his journey thanks to the heat of the setting he was in. the cyclist makes this statement. I was hitting my water bottle pretty regularly and I was traveling through the high desert of California in June. The cyclist is saying that since it is so  hot where he is he has to take regular drinks of water so he stays highdrated throughout is trip. It is also saying that in the mountians with less air and how hot it is he is not doing as well as he thought he would on the trip.	2
6598	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because they made the simplist challenges for him. The back of water and the snake in his path are examples.	1
6895	In the story the setting plays a big role in effecting the cyclist. The terrain was very hard at times such a big hills and windy torns. Also, there was no one around. no houses, buildings or people which made him fell alone and life he was going to die. The author describes the terrain in one part of the story Over onelong, crippling hill a building came into view! This quote shows how the hills in the seting were very big and hard to get over. It also shows the significance of a single building and how excited he was to see it. In the story the author described many features from the setting which all greatly effected the cyclist.	2
6613	The hills and bumpy road slow him down, and he is dehydrated. That is also slowing him down because he needs water. There are obsticles in the road too, such as, the big snake laying across the middle of the road. He is lost without water and could possibly die of an heatstroke.	1
6254	The features of the settings affect the cyclist in many ways when he starts of, he is bright and happy just as the slenecy is nice and calming. There is a pace that makes him feel like nothing wrong. I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face. After about @NUM1 miles on the cold, his life was getting low, and he came to his second abundant place. He then felt a little disturbed and worried. He needed to find a place with water. This site was trebling.  There he fins water plant not his hopes rise a bit, until he finds the water isnt good. A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brickish water feeling some which is in the neighborhood of two hundred trees. So he moves on and finally he re aches life! He is so relieved he cant believe his luck. Then as easily as rounding a body my troubles, thirst and fear were all behind me The setting affects the mood in a very big way, the cyclist feels as the setting looks.	3
7564	When riding a bike for a very long time with no water is bad but is even worst when your surroundings are worst. For example, when the cyclist has no water it is a day with nothing around him to help. Also with no water he could pass out & get dehydrated. When he finds no one to help & nothing around him he sucks on a pebble to keep his mouth hydrated. Therefor you should always check you destination on a bike before just going for it.	2
7368	In the essay the features of the setting affected the cyclist. The cyclist used words to discribe the setting like flat road and short, rolling hills, There were also more example. The way the cyclist discribed the setting gave the reader a visual picture. I think the cyclist was affected by the setting.	1
7266	In the essay, Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit by Kurmaskie, the cyclist went through hard times, trying to get to Yosemite National Park. A cyclist is someone who tried their bike mostly all the time to get somewhere. First off the cyclist asked old men for directions to get to Yosemite National Park. The cyclist knew that was a mistake in the first place, but he had hope that maybe they knew what they were talking about. Seccondly on his trip, he came accrossed an Ghost town with nothing in sight but a bike snake. The cyclist became dehydrated and was running out of water, the only water he	2
6942	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For one, his body heat raised a good bit. They dont come out and say it, but they do say, The sun was beginning to beat down. We all know that it your out side when its hot, you get hot too. It also probably added to his dehydryeon. As a long distance running, I know what the sun will do to you during a hot day. That is how the setting affect the cyclist.	2
6849	In the essay, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting greatly affected the cyclist. In this story, the cyclist is heading for Yosemite National Park, thinking it wise, he accepts directions from a group of eccentric old men. He begins his journey confidently on flat terrain and with a large supply of water. The first of three promised towns had been resigned to that of a ghost town. The second offered only water that slightly resembled battery acid. The cyclist soon becomes exhausted from lack of water and having to cross the now hilly terrain. He barely makes it to the third town to realize that the juice factory was out of business. The cyclist becomes sure that he is going to die of lack of water when he stumbles across a bait store. If it hadnt been so hot, if the towns along the way had offered better resources and if the terrain hadnt been so hilly, the cyclist would have had a very enjoyable ride. All of the affore mentioned factors of the setting greatly affected the cyclist.	3
6075	In the essay Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, the author changes the mood by not only telling us how the cyclist feels, but also by describing his environment. As he's leaving the resevoir compground hes feeling pretty good because hes just leaving the serenity of an early-summer evening and hes headed toward The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite. Hes in a beautiful setting and this affects the cyclist because hes anticipating another one. However, when he moves to the ghost town and the sun was beginning to beat down hes less confident and becoming more doubtful about the mens advice. However, hes still optimistic, finally it funny that it was once a thriving little spot. Next, when the cyclist comes to one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps and a coral he knows that things are in bad shape and he @CAPS1 water. However, all the have is a tarlike substance so he moves on, having no choice. When he comes to the rough road tumbleweeds and a ridiculously large snake it effects the cyclist by letting him know that things are at their worst and he can either give up, or keep pushing through. I doubt it could get any worse, and so does the cyclist. Finally, at the end the cyclists enters a rather modern bathroom and things are back to civilization for him, so he feels relaxed, relieved and much better. 	3
6092	The cyclist was affected by the heat. The fact was June , hes in the desert and has low on water were what almost lead to his own down fall. This hot desert setting sounds hostile and am Im surprised he lived and that he was that lucky.	1
7281	In the story Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit by Joe Kurmaskie the features of the setting affects the cyclist by draining him of energy, he is sweating so much, he keeps on drinking his water and slowly finishes it and still has a long ride ahead of him. The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.(Kurmaskies) since is was so hot the cyclist was thirsty and drank all of his water. It was a warm day and he needed to stay hydrated.	2
7151	The setting in the story was the high deserts of California in June. At first the cyclist had seemed really confident and excited about his journey. It was during it that had changed his mind. The cyclist was running low on his water supply's so he stops and pumps water from this water pump but all he gets is this acid taste. So he is on his way to the nearest town which is @NUM1 miles away and he thinks he can make it. So he is heading towards the nearest town when the terrain starts changing. It changes from flat road to short rolling hills. During this time the cyclist starts loosing hope. He thinks that he is going to die of dehydration and the birds are going to pick him apart. Then when he thought he couldnt make it he saw a sign that said Gary and @CAPS1 fish camp He ran into the shop and took long drinks from the sink in the bathroom and when he went out of the store an older gentle men asked him if he needed help and he said no I have a really good map. The thot temperature and rolling hills have a negative effect on the cyclist. I mean he goes from being confident to thinking he is seeing mirages and dieing. It states in the story I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasnt a mirage and I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean So this brought self doubting behavior. 	3
7332	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in these ways. The cyclist was very hot. wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt and the growing realization that I could drop from heartsroke on a gorgeous day in June. The towns that passed through that were supposed to have people were in fact deserted. His ride ended up being even harder than it would have been. This is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	3
6179	The setting of where you are riding has alot to do with the cyclist. In my own opinion I think the setting is the most important part.	2
7655	There are many things that could affect affect the cyclist. Like when they said , tomble weeds crossed my path is a ridiculously large snake. @CAPS1 her example would be when they said Not two miles into this next section of the ride I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. That is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	1
6510	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because there is mo water, hills, and deserts. When the cyclists saw water a wanting to jump in all he thought about was water that they lack like battery acid.Then the hills slowed him down from the water. The desert just made him want water even more. That are some features of the settings that affected the cyclist.	2
7219	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the rougher the terrain got the more the cyclist had to strain to make it. For example, when the terrain turned to hills, the cyclist had to struggle to climb the hills which caused him to use more of his energy. Also, if the terrain was flat and smooth, the cyclist had less problems making the long journey. For instance, if the cyclist had less strain on him then he would not be as tired and would not drink as much water. In conclusion, that is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	2
6382	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. The reasons were the water and the hills. One reason was water because his water were cooled down offer he refilled it all the way up. My last reason is because of the rolling hills.	1
6322	In the story, the setting greatly affects the cyclist. The cyclist, pedaling through California, is obviously very hot in the beautiful @DATE1. He also runs out of water, which nearly dooms him. But thats not the worst of it. The hills make him run out of water and energy even quicker. There are also no places to stop for water. The cyclist is lucky he survived the rugged terrain of California.	2
7156	Many features of the setting affect the cyclist. In the beginning, he cannot get water and becomes dehydrated, then, he goes on a rough ride and loses more energy. Then he finds the bait and gets water. All of these greatly affect the cyclists condition.	1
6801	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example the lack of water begins to take a toll of how fast he can get to the next town. Another example would be the terrain only slows him down more.	1
6367	In this story, No Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, by be Joe Kurmaskie I believe the setting greatly affect the cyclist. I believe this because when its long downhill cool roads is fine but if it is straight uphill roads and extremely hot he feels like he cant keep pedaling. The cyclist gets very weary when the setting is out in the hot desert with no one around so the setting has a huge affect on the mood in this story. Another example	2
6743	The setting affects the cyclist in alot of ways. The first way is that he was riding in the middle of a desert in June. If he was riding  in @LOCATION1, it woudn't be painfully hot. Also, the rolling hills probablly didnt help If it was mostly down hill, he would have been fine. Riding a bike up a hill when your tired is near impossible.	1
7482	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in bad ways. The rocky road and steep hills made him peddle harder. The old people made him go through the rocky way. The temperature from the desert made him thirsty so he ran out of water fast, He said When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid. The heat could have killed him anytime. For example Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from the heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June. This ride this man took to Yosemite was a very dangerous ride.  	2
7352	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many different ways. To start with, the terrain of the road turned from flat bumpy which caused the cyclist to have an easy trip. In the story it said, ""Rough Road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit."" Since the cyclist had to use a lot more energy on the roads and his water supply was limited, he became very thirsty when he finally say an old town ahead, he stopped and it looked like it was a bandoned he began to pump water out of the water pump and no matter how long it pumped for it looked like battery acid. The quote  from the story said, ""when I tried a drop or two, it hard the flavor of battery acid, that is some features of the setting that affected the cyclist throughout his journey."	2
6525	The author think that the setting means he is not getting any closer to his destination. However, he found out that there was still people around. He paniced and thought he was going to die. The places were desserted and he thought the lead nowhere. He was a little scared at the fact he might die because of everything around him was in a sense dead.	2
6703	The features of the setting affected the cyclist by making the journey more dangerous and difficult. For example, in the reading it states that rediculously large, poisonous diamond back snakes. Blocked majority of the pavement. So, the cyclist had to keep his/her balance to ease past them. The terrian also changed into short, rolling hills, making it even more difficult. 	1
6443	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For instance, If you were cycling in a very cold climate you wouldnt sweat as much and wouldnt need to drink as much water, but in the story the cyclist is in a very hot climate and he runs out of water, The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sps,wide cings of sweat circled my shirt and the growing realizating that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June This quote explains that the setting of the cycling plays a huge role in the cyclist. Also, the terrain can affect biker. If one was to ride on a flat terrain is gonna put much wearand tear on the cyclists body therefore the flat terrain would be easier. All of those reasons explains that the settings affect the cyclist in many  ways.	2
7435	'Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrian changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills'' (Kurmaskie @NUM1). When the cyclist realized the terrain was becoming difficulty he become more ignorant and hopeless. ''Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt; and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn't been off their porch in decades caused me to laugh. it was a sad, hopeless laugh'' (@NUM1). He wasn't goig to die, die but even though he was struggling, he made a big deal out of it. Unfortunately, the man lived. He would live on, telling people not to listen to old men. ''Never accept travel advice from a collection of old timerd who haven't left the confines of their porches since carter was in office'' (@NUM3). He was on a long, hot raod, and he started taking stabs at the old men ''I made a mental note to change that paragraph'' (@NUM4) The man was not forced to take direction from the old man. In his selfishness to cut back thos trip of only a few rough terrain, heat, and dehydration caused him to be hopeless,angry, and he felt sorry for himself.	3
7664	"The setting affect the cyclist in many ways. ""The journey nass make an snake this quote and that there made it seem like he is in the middle of know were and is ulcoming no plass because the man on the pourch said it would not be to far. The first town also was empty and when saw the town he was excited to go and feel a little out when he got closer he realized that the town has been abandoned this whole time so he was forced to keep going out the empty town made him feel almost hopless. In his attempts to make it to that next town, that how the setting mos affected the cyclist in the way that it did."	2
6798	The features of the surrounding landscape affect the cyclist both physically and mentally. First, the sun constantly beating down on the cyclist causes his or her body to sweat more, which makes ones body use more energy. The sun rays also add to the heat the cyclist feels. Also, the rough road forces the cyclist to pedal very hard, which drains him or her of even more energy. For example, when the cyclist in Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit reached the rough roads, he had to pedal harder, which made him sweat more, and caused his amount of energy to decrease. Finally, the lack of civilization can make a cyclist feel hopeless, which is how the cyclist in the essay felt when he had no water or could see no nearby town. This can affect the cyclists will to keep pedaling, and if they have no determination, the cyclist will not go anywhere. The features of the setting can physically exhaust and mentally strain the cyclist, which makes it harder for him or her to keep going	3
7416	During this bikers adventure heat and lack of water affect him. In this short story when the cyclist feels lost he says I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June This suggests that the rider was faced with the extreme heat of the desert during his ride. He also says The water bottles contained only a few tantilizing sips. This quote shows that not only was he faced with the heat, but also with lack of water. These facts and quotes show the clear threats this biker faced on his long bike-ride.	2
6545	The cyclist is in the desert which @NUM1 degrees with water that tastes like the battery acid. The desert makes him see the mirages having sweat get into his eyes. In the story  Do Not exceed Posted Speed Limit by Joe Kurmaskie 	1
6474	The features of the setting in this essay affected the cyclist in many ways. One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldnt hold in the lamest mule greeted me. (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist was expecting a small town with people in it and some type of good water supply. However he instead found a deserted ghost town with only a rusty pump that didnt even supply water. It made the cyclist feel depressed because he was running low on water and could easily dehydrate without it. The speed limit was @NUM2. I was doing a water-depleting @NUM3. sometimes life can feel so cruel. (Kurmaskie @NUM4). The cyclist is possibly being passed by cars on the highway going @NUM2 while he is only going @NUM3.This probably makes him feel as if he is getting no where at all. It would be all the more reason for him to give up. But he keeps trying to reach his destination. The feeling of being passed by the cars makes him determined to continue and finish his journey.	2
6059	The setting greatly affects the cyclist because he is the one riding over, short rolling hills, and arround a,ridiculously large snake, and because its hot he could suffer from heatstroke at any minut. So yes the author is affected by the setting	1
6846	Many features of the cyclists surroundings effect his speed and confidence. He was the only one on the road. There were no other cars, bikes, motor cycles, or even buildings. Its like hes on the countryside. So that makes him want to go faster, because he wont hit any thing. The fact that hes alone in the wide, open spaces boosts up his energy level and makes him feel more confident.	1
6061	"The features of the setting in Yosemite give the cyclist something in look forward to, but the feature of the sorting that he is in enduse in get there causes him despaire. As soon as the cyclist passes a ghost town and notices swettering hed of the sun during early endeavers of the trip he checks himself up as he says,""I brely noticed it [the sun], the cool pines and rushing hills of Yosemite had my name written all over them. Although the cyclist began to feel the toll that the trip and the sun was going to take on him, he erased the morning with the hope and bealy of arriving at Yosemite. The more the cyclist noticedthe sun the more he drank untill his water supply seemed low, striping as an old rusty water pump he had hope of being replenished but the taste of bitter battery acid caused the cyclist to stop drinking. The rolling hills, Sun and tumbleweds did nothing to quech the cyclist thirst or at least divert his assertion. If the cyclists was to see a sign that said Yosemite @NUM1 miles away his spirits would have risen, instead he saw a sign that said, Rough Road Ahead which did nothing to help him. If the terrain was more poporsed, easier to travel on and in plenty supply of water, the tune of this passive would be more hoped instead in such despair, the features of the setting caused the cyclist grief instead of hope."	3
6418	The dusty, dry setting has a serious effect on the cycling author. It got so long and hot that, @CAPS1 blues tune summer time rattled around inmy deteriorating brain. The author has spent so long cycling through heat, his brains starting to shut down. Its also because there is very little water left for him. Another problem is that every building/town except the last building is deserted. So without any chance of being refueled and restocked, its the author v.s nature. Plus, as the author states, the directions came from old people who, havent left their porches since Carter was in office. The word has greatly changed. Towns have become deserted, buildings rundown but the roads are kept in shape. The towns the old people mentions are now ghost towns, and are no help to the author. 	2
7211	The features of the setting had greatly impacted the cyclist. The heat, animals, and terrain had slowed him down throught his journey. The heat had slowed him down because he didnt have enough water to keep his boby moving normaly, and he said he had slowed him down because he had to sneak around it so it wouldnt bite him. The hills had affected the cyclist because it takes a lot of energy to go up there, when he said he couldnt see anything in sight.	3
6204	In the essay Do not exceed posted spedd limit by @PERSON1 many features of the setting effect the cyclist. First, when he arrived at the first town and said, this place might have been a thriving little spot at one time  say, before the last world war. This deserted ghost town setting was like a joke and had a small effect on the cyclist because it was the beginning of the day and he still had a good water supply. Though when he arrived at the ramshackle shed surrounded by several rusty pumps the effect it had wasnt so mild. He says, The sight was troubling. Then when he got on his hands and knees and started working the pump the situation didnt get much better. All that came out was a drop or two that tasted like battery acid. Lastly, when he arrived at an abandoned welchs Grape juice factory after several miles. This had a very wearing effect on him since the water supply was low and he had cycled into disappointment after disappointment. This setting in this essay seemed very abandoned and hopeless. It was only determination that got this cyclist through it.	1
6419	As the cyclist continues on his ride, changes begin to occur in the surroundings, which ultimately affects the cyclists attitude. When first starting out on his journey to Yosemite, the cyclist started out that morning, with strong legs and a smile on my face. He had received information from a few of the older locals that would help to cut the amount of time it took to arrive at Yosemite National Park. However, as he was riding, the cyclist realized that perhaps the older mens travel advice was a little out dated. with barely any water left to hydrate himself, and being surrounded by nothing but more road and desert, the cyclist couldnt help but laugh. It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself. At this point, the cyclist was mad at himself for not just using the map that he had brought with him instead of listening to the locals. Although the cyclist remained determined to find water, he had begun to lose hope when he suddenly came across a bait store. Here he was able to rehydrate himself, and with his renewed spirit, continued on his journey, this time using his map.	3
7270	The feature of the setting do affect cyclist in such ways making him illusionalistic and dehydrated. He saw all idea that a juice factory was working, when it was abounded. He saw rusty pipes, this made him dehydrated because he knew those pipes could never produce water.	1
7640	In the story Rough Road Ahead the author takes a trail he had previously heard about. After the ride didnt turn out to be what he expected it to be, the setting began to set in. The aridity of the climate would cause the author to have to struggle against himself and the conditions around him. Also his lack of water was a problem to begin with. Also his lack of water was a problem to begin with but the scorching sun would make him become dangerously dehydrated.	2
7613	"The features of the setting make the cyclist feel hopeless after realizing he is not on a short cut. The cyclist has the ""growing realization that [he] could drop from heatstroke"" as he rides along. Also, the only building he sees for miles ""had been @NUM1 Welch's Grape Juice Factory."" The cyclist is driven deeper into despair and feels that all hope is lost when he sees this building. As he rides on, the song ""'@ORGANIZATION2' rattled aroung in the dry honeycombs of (his) deteriorating brain."" At this point, the cyclist believes his own death to be inevitable. He saysown death to be inevitable. He says with any luck Id hit a bump and lodge one in my throat when talking about pebbles he placed in his mouth. Finally, the cyclist reaches a small bait shop, and all hope is returned as he drank deeply from the sink. The desert setting, with its lack of water, shelter, and people was the cause of this mans concern and later panic about his own life. The hopelessness of this cyclist is much like the hopelessness of those in the @ORGANIZATION1, who trapped in a blizzard far from civilization, resorted to eating their dead just to survive. While the @PERSON1 @ORGANIZATION1 went to extremes for their survival, their setting caused them to feel the same hopelessness as the cyclist."	3
7311	In the short story, Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit The cyclist experiences some difficult times. When starting the journey he had very little water. Because it was hot and dry his water went quickly leaving him very little water for the rest of the trip. The ragh roads also made him, tired making it harder to make the journey.	1
6692	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he cant go any farther because of the hills, and the snake. When he finds the bait shop hes relieved. He relieved because he can get something to drink. He can also buy the worms to eat. The cyclist didnt really know where he was going because there wasnt a car, building, or structure in sight. So the cyclist just keeps on riding until he comes across the bait shop or the first town as he calls it in the essay. When he comes across the road that has 55 mph per limit, and hes only 12 he knows that hes not going anywhere near Yosemite National Park.	2
5984	The cyclist was riding through a tower when he stopped for directions. These old men told him to take a short cut and he did and got lost. He was in a ghost town in the desert. In conclusion the desert is hot.	1
6181	The features of the setting affect of the cyclist because the setting changed so drastically. The flat wide open road turned into to short, rolling hills. Because he was already running out of water it was making harder for him to have the will power and determination to go up and down these hills. His determination started to fade because he started to see wide open lands with nothing but tumbleweeds and ridiculously large snakes. He felt like he was going to dehydrate because the sun was beating down and had no water left. He used pebbles that he had found to put in his mouth to help circulate the saliva he had in his mouth. He wishes that he would choke on one because he feels so useless. 	3
7670	A response that explains how the feature of the setting affected the cyclist. Would be that in the setting in the setting affected cyclist because for one the features of setting was based on something else. So that would be a reason how it would be affected. Because they're is differences in the stories.	0
7437	There are many things that can affect a cyclist's journey. This cyclist seemed to have bad wick. He starts off mentioning that he is planning a trip to Yosemite and the men that hear this give him a tip. The cyclist is pretty confident in what they tell him, so he follows their suggestions. He ends up getting lost. The cyclist is also travelling in the high deserts of California in June. That means that he is travelling in summer with dry air. When he gets to the first town he sees, he can it get the water he needs to rehydrate his body. He also runs into a snake while travelling through the desert, which slows him down. Because its hot, and hes tired, he begins to see mirages that affect him. All of these features cause the cyclists to take one long, tiring journey through the desert. These features also taught him the lesson to not take advise from old men who have not left their porch because their information @MONTH1 be out of date.	2
6848	this story is set in the hot in the hot desert in June and the character is a cyclist trying to get to a National Park. the setting affects the cyclist because the hotter it is the more water you need to keep you hydrated, but the man is alone in the desert. This quote about forty miles in the pedal I arrived as my first town. The place might have been a thriving little syos as one time. This quote shows how deserted the desert is and how as he rides there is nobody around no where to re-hydrate no where to get drecionsn he was alone.	2
6687	The setting from the story left the cyclist in a mental way because most of the time the sun was on his mind due to the fact that he was pedaling hard in a hot summer day in June. The cyclist had very little water and with him biking under a beating sun wasnt exactly helping him. He  had to like disasterous events like, peddling slopes than the normal speed, a snake blocking the path, old men telling to take a different route then be infected, and the fact that his water supply was low made him think he was going to pass out under the burning sun. However his determination was strong as he continued on pedaling through and he eventually found himself in another town but this time with people, fish and water.	2
6935	The features of the setting in the essay affected he cyclist because first of all he lisined to old fowks that havnt left their front porch in about ten years. Then he didnt ask someone elses apirean on where to go and how to get there. His worsed mistake tough was not trusting the map he had with him the howl time. If he would have just trusted his map and not when with when the old fella said he wouldint have almost died of heat stroke.	2
6465	There are many reasons how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. There are ways mentally and physically. The ways mentally is that the cyclists can loose determination and pride if they cannot fight the journey of cycling. The ways physically is the setting is hot and rough and the cyclist would have lack of water and food supplies. Those were the ways how cyclist would be affected by the features of the setting both mentally and physically. 	2
7025	The setting in Do Not @CAPS1 Posted speed limits affects the mood of the cyclist in that every time the setting changes the mood of the cyclist changes. In the begining of the story the cyclist is riding through the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite. @CAPS2 this time the cyclist is enjoying his trip and is in a positive mood. As the story goes on there was no one in sight, not a building, a car, or structure of any land. At this point in the story the cyclist has exchanged his positive mood for a desperate one as his water begins to run out.	2
7678	The terrain setting effect the cyclist in many ways. The fast that he was in a desert made him thirsty. There was no towns any sign of water to quench his thirst. The hills he would dtwepend than heartycle town just  made him moretired. These what the setting did to the cyclist.	1
5988	The setting of the authors  shortcut effected his performance and strength tremendously . whether it was the hills, heat or barren landscape all three took their toll on Joe Kurmaskie. Not only that, but his lack of water depleted his energy as well. Flat road was repalced by short rolling hills. The hills were a tough thing to pass since Joe was being drained of energy. He overcame this exhaustion when a building came into views. I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasnt a mirage, and tried not to get too excited with what I believed was my last burst of energy. I manouvered down the hill. The authour overcame all the problems ne faced even though it was difficult. He seems to have written this piece to exaggrate how important it is to keep going when you want to give up. Winston churchill once said,  success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage it takes to continues that counts. I believe that @PERSON2 agrees.	3
6857	The features of the setting in the essay affect the cyclist because as he was riding his bike throughout California, he entered hot deserts and was almost out of water. The cyclist was in a very bad dehydrated state as he was riding his bike, looking for water or anything drinkable that would successfully get rid of his dehydration. After a little while, the cyclist found himself alone in the desert with no one in sight. An example of this would be There was no one in sight,not a building, car, or structure of any kind. Another example to show how the cyclist was struggling and fighting against dehydration is wise rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that i could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in june simply because i listened to some gentlemen who hadent been off their porch in decades shown how the settings of this essay affected the cyclist greatly.	2
6867	The setting affects the cyclists because he can not take the heat. His water supply is running how and he is dehydrated. It says this when the characters says. The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide wings of sweat circled my shirt and the growing realization that I could drop from head strok This is saying he is afraid he might pass out and die before he finds more water.	2
7650	The setting of the story had effected the cycles becuse if it was sub earbs he could have stoped any where and got water but the plot was in a middle of a desert and all he could do is keep rolling and hoping to find some water For example, he had to go @NUM1 miles to get to the next town to get water and if he was not in the desert with hills he could have made that in no time at all    	1
7510	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in this story. First of all, in the story it says and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke (@NUM1). This quote shows that it is extremely hot and it is affecting his riding. The narrarator also says, I eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state(@CAPS1 @NUM2). This quote is saying that he is dehydrated in is having trouble keeping balance on the rough terrain. In conclusion, the setting affected the cyclist in this story.	2
7598	"The features of the setting in the essay Rough Road Ahead. affected the speaker by presenting challenges such as dehydration, dangerous animals and rough terrain in order to teach him a lesson about following travelling advice from old men. In the essay, he starts out confidently, on his journey after following their advice, reasoning that the men sounded no sense of themselves when pointing out landmarks and spouting off town."" The setting changes from cool to dry and barren with then mention of tumble weeds, and even changed to dangerous with the appearance of a diamondback snake that blocked his path in the end the setting changes back to comfortable, allowing him to learn his lesson through the hardship of the features of the setting, and follow his own map from then on."	2
7587	The features of the settings effects the cyclist by many reasons such as; dehydration, the road my cause bike to stop working. Since there is a lack of water in the dessert it seems, the guy could get dehydrated easily. The intense heat can cause that to. The road that he is riding on my cause the tires to pop.	1
6021	The features of the setting affect the cyclist alot. The hot sun beating down on him makes him sweat and makes him thirsty. The bumpy roods and hills make him work harder. The abandoned places make him lose hope. If faced with these obstacles I would have been affected in the same way. As I believe any human would be.	2
6244	The features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. One way it affects the cyclist is because of the weather condition. Being that it is very hot outside the cyclist does not have enough water. Another way it affects the cyclist is because of the condition alongside the road. For example the tumbleweeds and the snakes. Being that its not out most likely the desert is in process of a drought and he gets very dehydrated. I believe these are the reasons because it all makes a lot of sense and affects the cyclist.	1
6222	In this paragraph I will be explaining some features of the setting that affected the cyclist. One affect was the uneven, bumpy roads he was trying  to cycle on. If it was flat he wouldnt have to really be more aware, cause with bumpy roads he has to look out for rocks, holes in the road. Another affect are the hills. He had to put out more energy than if the hills were just flat. Those are some reasons that explain the features of the setting that affect the cyclist.	2
6173	Some features of the setting setting that affected the cyclist were signs that had speed limits. The sign affected the speed of the cyclist. Another feature was a hill on the route. This affected the cyclist by making him tired because he said I wipe the sweat from my eyes.	1
7062	The settings effect the cyclist by the roughness of the ride. First, they go over a bunch of rocks, and the tire could poys. Next it could be smooth and easy. Also, it could be far away from towns and difficult to get back. There could be a lack of water making you dehydrate. That is how the setting around the cyclist could effect him.	1
7051	The features in the setting would affect the cyclist because they would want to have towns with water so they can restock theyre water. They would want water even more after going up hills. They would also want a palce to gey something to eat and maybe rest.	1
6621	"The setting that were affecting the cyclist was the lack of water he had because it says the water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips,"" and the text also says "" Ild read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing the spit to circulate he wouldnt be trying to get his mind off of thirst if he wasnt thirsty."	1
6997	Setting plays a crucial part in the cyclists mood and energy. For example, in a cool @DATE1 day riding gently downhill, the rider is happy and energetic. However, traveling through the high deserts of California in June is not the best environment for laughs and ease. The cyclist in the story was hot exhausted, and hydrated. He thought, I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean. Where the cyclist rides can have a huge effect on the cyclist himself.	2
