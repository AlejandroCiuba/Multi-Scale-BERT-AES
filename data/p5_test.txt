To wrap it all up, the mood the author created in the memoir was about love and happiness."	3
13364	The mood created by the author in the memoir is greatful. For example, his parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to him their rich Culinary Skills and a love of cooking that is still with him today (and for which @CAPS2 is eternally greatful. That @CAPS1 that @CAPS2 loves to follow his parents goals and @CAPS2 loves them very much. In addition, @CAPS2 will always be greatful to his parents for their love and sacrifice. @CAPS2 has often told them how courageous they are for letting people into their home. @CAPS2 loves them for their strength and perseverance, and @CAPS2 has thanked them repeatedly. But in reality there is no way to express his gratitude for the spirit of generosity and pressed upon him as such an early age, and how @CAPS2 knows how important family and friends are.	3

13516	"In the memoir from ""Home: The blueprints of our lives"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood of this seems to be overjoyed, and happy. His life so far in @LOCATION1 must be great. For example, Narciso talked about how his sense of ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. Also, about passionate cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. As well as the love and sacrifice of his parents that was given to give him a better life. But most of all the mood gets serious at times, like when he talked about how his parents turned the simple house he lived in into a home.

Narcisco is obviously grateful towards his parents for teaching him how to love and that family or friends come first.

He learned that friends and family members are there to love and spend time with.	2

I know that because everywere in the article the author talkes about love and happieness.

13445	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, Narciso Rodriguez is an internationally recognized clothing designer. He talks about his hometown in Newark, New Jersey. In the memoir, he offers the true definition of ""family"". I felt like the mood was comforting, and loving, and heart-warming. Just by the way he talks about how much he loves his Cuban heritage, and how his mother and father immagrated from Cuba, to @LOCATION2, and how, even at a young age, they still managed to raise him, and do alot for him, and give him the best childhood they could give him, that he'll always remember. He also talks about how ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative"", meant that you could even consider someone not blood related to you, as your own flesh and blood, family."	2
13598	"The mood is shown and explained in several ways throughout the memoir. The mood of this short story is happiness and of a sense of family. The first example of this mood is in paragraph @NUM1 when the @CAPS1 says ""growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" @PERSON1 is showing that just because someone is not related to another person they cannot be family. Another example of the mood of the excerpt is when is when Narciso says ""My parents always kept to their arms and door opened to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" The @CAPS1 is showing that people who love each other like family have each other's backs, no matter what. A final example is when the @CAPS1 states ""I learned the real definition of family. And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or many things I learned about how to love."" The @CAPS1 is saying he is greatful for the people who showed him what ""family"" really is. In closing this story shows true family and how a house becomes a home."	4
12296	"The author in the memoir tried to create a specific mood. This mood is appreciation. He is saying all the things he is thankful for. ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly..."" In this quote he is thanking and appreciating all the work his parents went through to give him a good life. He is also admiring the things they went through such as leaving behind their families, and careers in the country they loved. He is greatful for the house he lived in and he looks back at the memories of them cooking in the kitchen again, with the smells of Cuban foods, and sounds of Cuban music. He expresses all of this in the last few lines of the memoir that state: ""And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" In conclusion, the author's memoir is all about his appreciation of the good things that came to him in his childhood, and the memories he will never forget"	4
12394	The mood created by the author in the memoir was love. One way that he expressed this in the memoir was by saying that his man had let in other immigrants to their house. Also a way that this was expressed was by saying that his parents selflessly left Cuba to get a better life for their children. Furthermore the author of the memoir expressed this by saying that his family turned this simple house into a home. This is the mood that the author created in the memoir	2
13003	A mood for the memoir would be redeaming. It would be a redeaming mood because it talks about strugles like being an immagrent and being poor. It also talks about how a community that is going through the same strugles can come together and help each other out. The author also mentions how her parents sacrificed a lot to help her acomplish what she has become today. Since there are tradteties that help the author lead to success it would be a redeaming mood.	2
12923	In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, it explains how your house can effect you as a child and when you grow up. The mood of this memoir to me is comforting. I think this because when the memoir said that he had plenty of relatives around, and freinds that probably made him feel comfortable. Also his parents were very welcoming and kind so you would probably feel comfortable because of that too. That is what I think the mood of the memoir is and why.	2
12707	"The @CAPS1 in the @CAPS2 is different and uneek to other I have heard. I belive that the @CAPS1 the @CAPS3 is trying to make is happyness, and selflessness, and grateful. I think this because he describes his parents As selflessness and takes everyone in to theire small Apartment. I also think he is creating ""warth"" by saying that his first birthday with his parent Are comfortting That is the @CAPS1 I belive the @CAPS3 is trying to create. "	2
12327	"This memoir definatley has a strong and apperent mood, and that mood stands out to me as Narciso being grateful, he is obiously very thankfull to his parents and family. I know this because the memoir says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" This quote really shows that @PERSON1 is thankfull for his parent's love for him.This mood comes out in the memoir when @PERSON2 says ""But, in reality there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important Family and @CAPS1 are."" This quote shows how he is thankfull for his Family, but also how his Family shaped him as a person.In all, There are many emotions in this story, but the one that @CAPS2 out to me the most was him being gratefull."	3
12085	"The mood of this memoir created by the author is a grateful and/or thankfull mood. The mood is grateful because in the first several paragraphs it mentions how their home is not a high quality and they do not live a average middle class life but a severely lower-class life. However throughout the excerpt it is mentioned how whatever they lacked in quality they made up for with the coming together of their ""family"". By family it means how the other immigrants came together as one and helped one and another. Narciso mentions how even though his family had very little to share, they would always share all that they had to offer with anyone who needed it. By following this example mainly set by his parents he learned about life's lessons that he will never forget and is forever thankful and grateful to his parents for showing him."	3
12284	"The mood conveyed in the memoir is love. The author talks about how thankful he is for his parents love and sacrifice. In other words, he loves his parents because of the love they showed him. Also, the author discusses the unity and love between his family and neighbors. Although they weren't blood related, they formed family-like relationships. Furthermore, the author states, ""a cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love."" Just the mere smell of his mother's cooking brought love to the entire room. To conclude, the author used many examples to explain to readers the love that was shared in his home."	2
12034	"The author created a very grateful/happy mood in the memoir. For example in paragraph @NUM1 when Narciso says ""I will always be greatful to my parents for the love and sacrifice. When he is saying this he is showing he is happy w/ his parents. I the memoir he talks about how he loves his house and why he loves his house and all the great memories in that house and that shows that this memoir mood is a more happy mood instead of sad for example paragraph @NUM2 when he says ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this combo house were a cuban feast always filled the air with not just sent and music but life and love."" Also when he said in paragraph @NUM2 that"" It here where i learned the real defenition of family. And for this i will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things i learned there about how to love."	3
13061	I think the mood was happy and @CAPS1. Because They @CAPS2. The boy Loved his parents. They had to leave theirs friends. Some family there and They would miss them, but the parents wanted a better life for thier children. They were @CAPS1. to Move.	1
12678	The mood that was created @CAPS1 the @CAPS2 is a happy, loving mood. The reason I say this is @CAPS3 if you read the passage you'll see that in his home it wass all about love and care. So in the end they have mad a Home and a @CAPS4 relationship together and with other people. the authors family @CAPS5 in their home people that they considered Family, this right here is a mood well a caring mood.	2
13150	"The author of the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, talks a lot about home and how you can find family were your not expecting too.He sets the mood in the memoir, that portrays love, warmth, and happyness. The overall mood of the memoir is loveing. Like how Narciso says in paragraph @NUM1, ""And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about love.""When Narciso was growing up he learned that ""... Family had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" All the cultures in his neighborhood came together in unity and Friendship. So Narciso Rodriguez wants to create a warm, loving, @CAPS1 mood to his memoir, just like he experienced growing up!"	3
12117	"According to the memoroir the mood created by the author is he is thankful for everything his parents have gave him. For example, he states in paragraph @NUM1 ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.""Narciso always told his parents how greatful his is for them. But Narciso says ""But in reality there is no way to express my gratitude."""	2
12009	"Narciso Rodriguez created a mood of happiness and comfort in the memoir. When he told that ""... all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" it signaled to me that they all must be happy together. And when Rodriguez describes how all of the Cuban traditions his parents brought blended it just made me think he was comfortable with his home."	2
12753	"By writing the story, the author created a mood full of warmth and comfort. The mood created in this story shows how family should be. When @PERSON1 says that ""they take anyone in until they are back on their feet"", this shows that they appreciate their family and they are all close. This shows that they care for one another contributes to the mood by showing love and warmth towards another person. A second way about the mood is when he talks about his kitchen and how much it means to him. When he talks about the love of culinary skills and cooking which is still with him today it creates a solemn mood that sets the tone of the story. Third, where he talks about his neighborhood. @PERSON1 talks about the immigrants in the area and how they come together with their different backgrounds. This shows that they show affection for one another and that everyone is the same. This sets the mood too by showing everybody needs to be nice to everyone. These three parts set the ""mood of the story."	3
13036	"Througout the story, Narciso Rodriguez shows examples of how grateful, loved, and unified his family felt with their struggles they had overcame and heritage they were proud of. Paragraph @NUM1 illustrates the fond memories Narciso has of his house and childhood. Paragraph @NUM2 displays Narciso's strong sense of family within his local @CAPS1 community. Paragraph @NUM3 explains Narciso's parents' rough journey from Cuba to @LOCATION1, and paragraph @NUM4, Narciso explains how grateful he is for his parents' hard work and determination for their children to have a good life. ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love"" wraps up the whole article and shows how grateful and cared for Narciso feels for his warm, welcoming home celebrating life, love, and their Cuban culture."	2
12432	"The mood created by the author, @PERSON1, in the memoir was grateful and it had gratitude. In paragraph @NUM1 he says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" His parents sacrificed their families, friends, careers, and the country they love to selflessly come to @LOCATION1 to give their son a better child hood because they loved him that much. Even though they had to change jobs and take any possible work. They also struggled with finances, harsh northern winters, and cultural hardship that wouldn't give up and that's why the author was grateful, creating the mood. "	3
12236	"The author creates many different moods throughout the memoir. In the beginning, the author talks about his traditional Cuban home, in which he feels extremely comfortable and safe. Here, he creates a mood of warmth, and a very family oriented upbringing, all positively. Around paragraph @NUM1, the author begins to talk about his pride in the success and determination of his family. For example, (paragraph @NUM1, final sentence) ""The faith that this struggle would lead them and their children to better times drove them. (his parents) to endure these hard times."" This gives a mood of pride and great triumph. That is the mood that @PERSON1 gives in the memoir from ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives."""	3
13338	I believe that the mood in this memoir is happy because the athor is talking about his first friend (land loards daghter) the great cooking and music that his home had. how greatful he is to his parents for moving to america for him, all the celibrations they had for people, how everybody in the naborhood were friends, and much he loved his family. What about that is unhappy	2
12839	"Narciso Rodriguez creates a very calm and grateful mood from beginning to end in his memior. First of all, he describes the selflessness of his parents.

He understands that they only left for his benefit, and he appreciates that. Also, Narciso is thankful that although his parents moved to the United States, they kept their Cuban traditions. In Narciso's three room apartment, ""Passionate Cuban music... filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen"" (@CAPS1 @NUM2). Lastly, Narciso expresses his appreciation, and strengthens the mood by defining what a home is. He claims that he ""will never forget how [his] parents turned the simple house into a home"" (@CAPS1 @NUM3). For these, Narciso is grateful for, and his appreciation creates a calm, inviting, and grateful mood."	3
13124	"This excerpt called ""Narciso Rodriguez"" written by Narciso Rodriguez, he sets a light, happy mood. I say this because throughout the whole story, he is describing all the good things about his parents and his household during his childhood. A few examples are in paragraph @NUM1, where Rodriguez states ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family"". When he says this, it gives the reader a good feel of how his parents cared for anyone who needed their help. In paragraph @NUM2, Rodriguez says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" When he says this, it is another time he is telling us he is grateful for his family.

He also mentions how greatful he is to his parents. ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"". One last fact that contributes to the mood of this memoir, is Narciso's view on family. ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative... In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship"".From this excerpt it is clear that the author cherish this time, and would love to go back."	3

Throughout the whole memoir, narciso's affectionate language and explanation to his life and his parents was constant and grasping. In paragraph two, he uses perenthesis as if his gratitude is so strong, that he can't bear to leave out how thankful he is. He set the scene with new experience and inspiration, Which he always thanked his parents for introducing him to. ""I will always be grataful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.

12325	The mood created by the author in the memoir is loving. The mood of the memoir is loving because Narciso's home reminds him of his old country. The author talks about his grand parents not being able to come to @LOCATION1 until 1970. Narciso's house was turned into a home that reminded him of Cuba.	1
12868	The mood created by the author is love and @CAPS1. Because the author talks about how growing up was. The author helps babysitting. And the author sounds like a nice person. thats what the author's mood is.	1
13450	In this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, there is a mood of joy, and hope. His parents came to @LOCATION1 in a time of racial segregation. they persevered through the hard time with their child by having close bonds with Friends and Family that lived nearby. Culture was passed on to Narciso and he loved the @CAPS1 and music he grew up with. Narciso's @CAPS2 always invited Family into their home when they needed help. Also, many people that weren't related to them shared dinner with them each night. In the Rodriguez's home, there was hope to get better and joy For the moment.	2
13106	"All these things that I listed all had something to do with creating the @CAPS1 in this  memoir. But the biggest feeling of all is love his parents went all the way from Cuba just to give @CAPS2 a better life, Even if it meant leaving their jobs, family, friends all behind just to give their son a better life. Also after they arrived they lived in a one room apartment for a year then moved to a new house and made it ""our traditional Cuban home"" so it would teach their son about the place where they came from and to make it feel natural for Narciso When he was born. Even after that they were still kind and had open arm for other immagrants. So I absolutly think that the @CAPS1 in this memoir is about an overwhelming feeling of love."	3
11952	The mood created in the memoir is greatfulness. Narciso is telling the story in honor of his parents selflessness. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do. They worked as hard as they could and made him a home and a childhood he could be happy with.	1
12054	"The mood created by the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" is very uplifting and happy. One reason I think the memoir is uplifting and happy is because it talks about how greatful Narciso is of his parents. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""I will allways be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" I thought that this line was very meaningful and uplifting because he's basicaly thanking his parents for immigrating and giving him a better life. Another reason I think this article is uplifting and happy is because in paragraph @NUM2 it says ""Growing up in this enviorment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with a blood relative."" I found that uplifting because essentially what he is saying that family doesn't allways mean who you are related to but the people around you that love and support you. Lastly this article is uplifting because it shows love can make a difference."	3
13152	The author created many different moods in this memoir. An obvious one is Love. As a child @CAPS1 really appreciated that her parent gat anew home and moved to @LOCATION1 to raise their child. @CAPS1 loved her cuban background and environ ment that @CAPS1 grew up in.	2
13280	"The mood of the memoir is gracious. Rodriguez is grateful for many things listed in this memoir. In paragraph @NUM1, @CAPS2 says @CAPS2 is grateful for his inheritance of the cuban culinary gift. In @CAPS1 @NUM2, by saying ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life."" @CAPS2 shows his gratitude for his parents moved to @LOCATION1. In paragraph @NUM3 @CAPS2 shows his gratitude for his parents love in the quote ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Rodriguez is also grateful for the love and hapiness of the home. @CAPS2 evidences this in paragraph @NUM4 in the quote, ""it was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music and love. It was here where I learned the definition of family"". @CAPS2 goes on to say, ""I will never forget this house or it's gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned about how to love"". Rodriguez is gracious for his family, home, and life in this memoir."	3
12106	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a happy and loving mood. It sets a loving mood whe the author says, ""Growing up in this enviornment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood realitive."" This sets a loving mood because the author is pretty much saying that a person can be so close to you and love you that you consider them family even though you are really not even related. It also sets a happy and loving mood when the author says, ""They came selflessly, as immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" This quote shows that Narciso's parents love their children so much that they wanted them to have better lives and to be happy. That is the mood created by the author in this memoir."	3
12219	"In the memoir, @PERSON1, from: Home: the blue prints of our lives, the mood created by the author is happy, thankful and also familyorented. First @CAPS1 says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"", and which by that you can tell @CAPS1 loved that new home, and that @CAPS1 loved and appriciated everything her parents did for her.Second, ""... instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being blood relative"". Which @CAPS3 that @CAPS1 treats and acts like everyone is her ""family"", because @CAPS1 loves and cares for all of he ""family"" that isn't blood relative in her neighborhood as if the were blood relative.Last, the memoir says ""... endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"". @CAPS1 says ""warm home,"" that ment @CAPS1 loved being home with her family/etc. And that @CAPS1 loved being with her friends and neighbors, because thats what @CAPS1 loved/loves to do. therefore @CAPS1 is happy."	4
13156	"The author's mood in this memoir is gratefulness, happiness, and gratitude. In paragraph @NUM1, the author shows happiness, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations... formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" As you can see the author was very happy to move to @LOCATION1 to start a new, fulfilled life. In paragraph @NUM2, the author shows gratitude towards his willing parents. ""They came selflessly as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life..."" here the author shows that he's extremely grateful for what his parents did to help him make  a new life. Lastly, in paragraph @NUM3, the author tells direct explanation to why he's grateful. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1, the author in this memoir shows an extreme amount of gratitude, happiness, and gratefulness, to his sacrificing parents"	3
11912	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is how she learned the definition of ""family"". She learned the definition of ""family"" at what she calls it her ""simple house"". I know this because in paragraph @NUM1, she says ""It was here where I learned the definition of ""family.' "	2
12754	The mood is good and happy. In this artical the mood is peaceful and positive. It's a secsesful mood also great-full because @PERSON1 is greatful for everything.	1
12638	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is joyfull and grateful. The author is joyfull because in stanza two Narciso states ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adored to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" This shows that the childhood of this person was joyful with the culture, family, friends, foods, and smells. This person is very grateful for all of the things he parents did. Such as when the author states ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could've ever done. I thank them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for this period of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" This shows that the author is truly grateful for everything the parents had done for him or her and he or she is really joyful now thinking back and makes the mood of the memoir joyful and grateful."	3
13613	In the story memoir the author created a couple of different mood to decribe the story.      The first mood was greatfullness. The author described greatfullness tword the parents when the author was discribing selflessness caring of the parants when they made the disision to move to @LOCATION1 to give them a better life. The last mood discribed by the author was happyness. The author discribed happiness in the story when it was discribing the parents making everyone feel at home These are the differend moods discribed in the story by the author.	2
12596	"Living life in a country or place away can be very difficult from what I've known, heard and seen. Poverty often takes over the situation with a side of racism and discrimination occasionally. Nonetheless, this well-told memoir tells of the contentment and good side of it all. The happiness that was created in a place that Narciso calls home. In the home, he still got to experience Cuban culture including music, traditional cooking and best of all ambiance of family being around. ""Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This quote kind of lightens up the whole idea of this memoir and how people from all over came together to celebrate the wonderful joys of life even though at times they were frowned upon."	2
12235	In this memoir the mood that was created was security and warmth. I say this because throughout his story he talks about how grateful he is to have parents who cared about him so much they moved to the United States to give him a better life than what he would have had in Cuba. Narciso constantly talks about the food that his mom used to make and has taught him. The unity that the neighborhood has formed. When he was young there was still a lot of racism and segragation from whites to other races and because of that his neighborhood was the only place to feel at home and feel like they didn't have to prove anything. Their house was permanently open to whoever needed it, and his parents would feed and be overall kind to them. This memoir is about Narciso Rodriguez's kind and loving family, and that comes off strongly in his story.	3
12160	"In this memoir about @PERSON1 the reader learns alot about the @CAPS1 by the mood (or tone) of the memoir. The mood of this memoir is greatful, because he is thinking of all the opportunities he got to have since his parents were so caring and selfless.     In the memor the reader learns that parent makes so many sacrifices for their children that helping around the house and thanking them is the least they can do.      In conclusion the mood in the memoir Home: The @CAPS2 prints of Our Lives by Narciso Rodriguez is, happy, and greatful because of the sacrifices made by his parents. A good citation for this is ""even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."""	3
12274	"The @CAPS2 is trying to describe his house when he was a kid. In this case he describes his Cuban heritage and how being @CAPS1 is really fun and amazing. The @CAPS2 is saying that the Cuban kitchen is pouring out with amazing foods and during holidays his ""Family"" would come and visit. Cuban is a very exciting culture is what pops into my head after reading this story. The mood is that festivitys and holidays are the best for him."	1
13377	"In the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez, he gives a mood throughout it. I think that if is that home is really where the heart lies and blooms. Paragraph two states, ""the congregation of family and friends... formed the backdrop to life in our warm home.' In paragraph seven, 'It was in this simple house my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country.' Rodriguez wrapped it all up with what really showed what the mood was, 'I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,' in paragraph seven."	2
13442	"Narciso Rodriguez's memoir creates and overall mood of love and compassion for family and shows the strength of his own family. Narcisco explains that his parents love of cooking and willingness to let other people in ""instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood realative."" Also, this memior shows people facing hardships. Narciso explains his neighborhood, and family overcame racism together. This sets the mood that they love eachother. Lastly, this memior shows love and sacrifice. Narciso explains that his parents ""struggled both personally and financially."" during their move to @LOCATION1. But Narciso's parents still showed him to love. From his parents, Narciso has learned to love, and for that he admires his parents."	3
12932	The mood in the memoir was in a way sad. The reason why it was kind ave sad is how they came into this country with nothing. They had to live in a @NUM1 bedroom apartment. Even though that they still made it up to being able to make money. They got a better living style too.	1
12712	The memoir looks back on his childhood, with fondness, so I'd call the mood whistful. Yes, the author creates a whistful mood, by talking about his childhood home, friends and family. But... whistfulness only lasts until the end of paragraph @NUM1... after that it becomes a greatful mood, where he's giving out thanks and describing what his parents went through. If it is possible to have two moods, then this memoir does. The moods are both whistful and greatful. Yes.	2
12006	The mood created by the author in the memoir is sad, and happy because he talks about things that happened to his parents and happy things of his parents. I think the author is sad because they died but he could be happy too. I think I would be sad and happy if my parents died. Thats why I think the mood created by the author in the memoir is sad, and happy. My Parents, originally from Cuba, arrived in the united states in 1956. In 1961, I was born into this simple house. I think he was happy where he was born.	1
13472	"     In this memoir, Narciso Rodriguez speaks with nothing but warm fondness and gratitude as she describes her childhood home. The loving way she talks about her parents' appartment and their kitchen and the Cuban culture they combined into their everyday lives suggest that Narciso has wonderful memories of her parents. Obviously, she is very grateful for everything her parents did for her and the chance for her to grow up in such a tender community - where ""'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" (@NUM1) The entire memoir is written with such care and attention to sweet detail. The author clearly feels blessed that her parents sacrificed their safety in their homeland to bring her to @LOCATION1 in order for her to live a better life, to experience the importance of friends and family, and to learn about the true meaning of love through Cuban culture."	3
13042	The mood created by the author I think he was in a good mood because the story didn't talk about nothing bad it talk about happiness and how parent reas their @CAPS1 with no help of any one, and how their @CAPS1 felt when they were big they were happy and proud.	1
13414	The mood the auther was in was @CAPS1 & happy. The reason It was happy & @CAPS1 is because they talked about Being @CAPS3. And living in a @NUM1 @CAPS4 apartment.	1
11918	"I think that the author created a very warming, and the loving tone. Narciso created this mood by including all of the greatest aspects of his home in @LOCATION1. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 he explains the endless celebrations he had with family and friends that ""... formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."""	2
12043	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" the author is happy. The author describes his home is a place for family. He is grateful to his parents for everything they did.

In the memoir it says, ""Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen. My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" The author talks about how his/her home was full of Cuban culture and how great Cuban food is. The author also says, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative... In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" The author is grateful and proud because her parents welcomed with open arms people of all types. The author was also proud that he/she was so close with neighbors that they were like relatives. This is why the mood created in the memoir is proud."	3
12748	"There is a warmth kind of family mood in this memoir, @PERSON1. This mood is portrayed in many ways. One way the mood is portrayed is by telling us about @PERSON1's parents. And how there home is always open or how theres always ton of people at the dinner table. Another way they portrayed this mood is by @PERSON1 stating ""there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity.... the demonstration of how important my friends and family are. This is how they show the warmth kind of family mood in this memoir, @PERSON1."	3
12422	"The author's mood was a very grateful and good mood throughout the memoir. The author loved everything about these memory's. For example, ""and a love of cooking that is still with me today (for which I am eternally gratefu)"". The author shows that he is in a good mood by saying he is eternally grateful. His mood was also very appreciative. For example, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind families..."". The author is very thankful and appreciative to his parents that came to the United States from Cuba just for him. He has thanked them many times. The author also shows his gratefulness again at the end of the passage. For example, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"". The authors parents bought a house that was big enough for his family and his mood was grateful due to his parents. Lastly, the authors mood was very thankful. For example, ""It was here where I learned the real definition of ""family"". The author shows that he learns family and is very thankful to his parents for that. That's how the authors mood was."	4
13108	"The author showed his mood very clearly in the memoir. The way he worded things such as ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house in to a home"" Showed how happy he was toward his parents. He told us how greatful he was for his parents being so selfless and thinking about him first. He also makes it clear how he is proud and how he greatly respects his parents for the great things they did to improve his life. Also he shows how he admires his parents hard work and bravery for the things they have done. In conclusinon, His overal mood I think is his gratatude toward his parents."	2
13002	"The mood of this memoir is @CAPS1. I say this @CAPS2 his family always let people from the neighbor hood come over and they were like family. His parents let people stay with them ""until they got back on their feet."" @CAPS3 admired his parents for their ""strength and perseverance"". Through everything they had been through."	2
11853	In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez the author creates a serious, happy and thankful mood. The author was serious to the point where his family had to go through economic and personal problems. However, the author was happy how they lived in a friendly and unified neighborhood with other immigrant from different countrys. The author showed thankfulness because his parents worked so hard to give him a new life. The memoir showed a good mood as well as a accurate portrait of the athour childhood.	2
12068	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives. Narciso projects a very greatful, thankful + optimistic mood. Every sentence, he thanks a specific person for bringing such greatness to his life. In paragraph six, Narciso says, ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" and it shows that Narciso is very greatful towards his parents, for bringing him to @LOCATION1, and him being who he is today, + who he was. Narciso also projected off a happy and thankful tone. He felt that his life was made so much better in @LOCATION1, than it wouldve or could've been in Cuba. Lastly, Narciso appears to be optimistic. Although he came from a little two-family home, he was still very hopeful about how his life would be better in @LOCATION1, and thanks his parents for their generous sacrifice. In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" Narciso appears to be a grateful, thankful + optomistic man."	3
12637	"The mood given by the author in the memoir is sweet, loving, and grateful. The author uses many kind, gracious words to describe his family and uses things from what we picture as an ideal family to create an even more colorful image for us to see. He uses imagery and sensory language; which helps us feel I homey atmosphere when we read. In the neighborhood he lived in, ""... all of these cultures came together in a great solidarity and friendship,"" and that shows how close everyone was to one another and how rich of cultures that had come together. (¶@NUM1 line @NUM1) @CAPS1, in paragraph @NUM3, the author explains how grateful he is to his parents which showed him the lessons which became the root of his life. As most children experience through their lives, they are greatly influenced by their parents. To have his parents teachings be the basis of his life, he must have had a deep connection with them. As he talks about his home and that his ... ""parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed..."" them on to him, it shows how observant he is and how caring his parents are to have the time. These words create a very sweet, loving, and gracious mood to the memoir."	4
11964	"The mood of ""Narciso Rodriguez"" is @CAPS1 much the same throughout the whole excerpt.   In the story, the mood the whole time is calm and relaxed. Narciso talks about his family and how much he loves them and what they have done for him. It says in the story ""Growing up in this enviroment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" @CAPS1 much throughout the story, this is the mood.       Another mood created by the author is gratefulness and thankfulness. Narciso is thankful to his parents selflessness. In the story, Narciso says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The way he talks about his parents ends up making the reader thankful too.     Narciso Rodriguez creates happy moods for us by the way he writes with love about his family and how he cares so much about what they did for him."	3
12282	"The mood of the author Narciso Rodriguez was he was always proud of his culture and mom and dad. For example in paragraph two it talks about @CAPS1 where he lived and how he said that he ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day)"". ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). In the story @PERSON2 always excepted anything and was kind and always wanted to see his parents smile. And he was positive and honest. And he even talked about his community ""It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" And Narciso also said ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love."""	3
12131	"The mood  in the memoir could be many things the one that really stands out to me though is grateful. One way how @CAPS1 shows this is @CAPS1 says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice @CAPS1 is so thankful that her parents brought her to @LOCATION1 so @CAPS1 could live a wonderful life.Another way @CAPS1 shows @CAPS1 is grateful is @CAPS1 says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" @CAPS1 respects what her gone through to make her life enjoyable and not like what her parents lives were.The last way @CAPS1 shows gratefulness is @CAPS1 thanks her parents every day for what they have done. ""I've thanked them repeatedly"" @CAPS1 says in paragraph @NUM1. I don't think @CAPS1 could ever picture what her life would be like if her parents didn't do that for her. This is what I think the mood is in the memoir."	3
13250	"In ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez a happy, loving and grateful mood is created. Narciso writes ""Growing up in this enviroment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" @CAPS1 loves the people that @CAPS1 calls his family, even if they aren't really related. @CAPS1 talks about Alegria, his first friend, and Sergio and it Edelmira, his surrogate grandparents. Narciso aknowledges the fact that his parents left behind their old life and came to @LOCATION3 for him. @CAPS1 says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1 knows that his parents care about him more than they can ever express. Narciso knows that his neighborhood was a huge part of his life and proves it by writing ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" I think that overall it is an upbeat article about a man's past, where she learned the defenition of love, and how grateful @CAPS1 is to those who taught him it."	4
12119	"In the memoir ""@PERSON1"" by The Blueprints of Our lives, the mood created by the author is happyness.The mood in the memoir was happyness. It because the mother showed he how to love people. Quote she said... Always filled the air with not just scent an music but life and love. It was there I learned the real difinition of ""family."" That many family is just not the people you love and not being a blood relative. I like when her mom let anybody to there household to the table.In the mood that created by the author is happyness in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez."	2
12699	"The mood created in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" is of happiness, peace, and gratitude. Narciso is thankful for all that his parents had sacrificed and taught him His overall tone in the memoir is translated into a happy and peaceful mood. Narciso writes ""the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop of life to our warm home."" The tone in this quote is calm and friendly, as Narciso explains the happiness of his life at home. By saying his house was ""warm"" with celebrations for family and friends, it constructs the peaceful mood of the memoir.     Narciso goes on to explain that ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family. Here, Rodriguez adds to the peaceful mood by speaking of generosity, and care towards family. It is the idea family that fueled his loving childhood. The mood turns to gratitude as Narciso thinks his parents for giving him a better life, though they had to endure difficult jobs and conditions. He expresses that he had ""no way to express [his] gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon [him],"" and ""the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" The concepts of family, love, and generosity Narciso learned from his parents formed the basis of the gracious, happy, and tranquil mood of his memoir, as well as his life."	4
13063	The mood created by the author in this memoir was more of a homey-heart touching mood. To know that his family helped other immigrants in their time of need, in any culture, was really getting the point across. That where you live is just a house until you make it a home.	1
13297	The mood of the memoir was warm and happy. The author talks about how is parents were poor and just moved to the United States from Cuba. He then says he had a wonderful life even though his family didn't have a lot of money. All that mattered was that they had their family and friends around them every day. Narciso says how his parents gave him the love and skill to cook and how he still has that love and his love for Cuban music. This memoir basically says how Narciso's parents were people who realized the more important things in life. It's not all about the fame and fortune. Its about love and family and spending time together.	2
12528	The mood created by the author in the memoir is happiness and love I think that this memoir is about happiness because in paragraph @NUM1 he explains how fun and happy his home is. And his family cooks together which he really appreciates and @CAPS1. I also think this memoirs about love to because through out the whole memoir he talks about his appeciation and love for his family and friends. And thats why I think the mood of this memoir is happiness and love.	2
12794	"I think the mood is suppost to be sad for many reasons. One reason is that he keeps saying how his house isnt a home untill the end. Such as ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home. Another reason is that his friends and family is all he got. Such as ""...how important family and friends are. Also because he had to move, so he didnt no anybody. Such as ""...Originaly from Cuba, arrived in the United States in 1956."	2
12571	"In the memoir, the author doesn't just describe the journey to @LOCATION1 and the house he lived in. He gives a in depth and warm description of his life in @LOCATION1 and the relationships he made. He also spends some time talking about the selflessness of his parents and what they do to make the new immigrants feel welcome in this new place.The author sets the mood that makes people wanna read this if they are feeling sad and they just want to get a warm, cozy feeling from it. I think the mood in this gives off a sence of being selfless, but also coming together when all are segregated and form unity. When you turn segregation into unity then good things are bound to happen. The authors says this in his memoir: ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" The mood of this story really shows you that the world doesn't have to be a cold, heartless place.If we do as they do, we can all live in unity."	2
13049	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" (who is also the author) is writing about his live changing experience. The mood of the poem is happy. His parents immagrated from Cuba to the United States in 1956. When he was growing up he learned all Cuban traditions and envied them all. He's very proud of his parents for the risk that they took for him. This is why the mood of the story is happy."	2
12881	"In the memoir the author creates a mood that is calm and comfortable. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 he says ""Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen"" that shows that his house is without no yelling or fighting. Also, in paragraph @NUM1 he says ""the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed backdrop to life in our warm home"" that shows while he grew up his home was comfortable for him. In paragraph @NUM3 it says ""the kitchen in this humble house where a @LOCATION1 feast always filled the air but life and love that showing that his family was calm and loved each other. The author says in paragraph @NUM3 ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home"" that shows he was comfortable growing up in his house even though he didn't have lots of things. In conclusion, the author creats a mood for the memoir."	4
12995	the mood of the @CAPS1 in the article is like kind of happiness and @CAPS2, relax, and grateful. Because their grandparents are coming from Cuba. Narciso Rodriguez feels like being an immigrant from Cuba and making a family in the United States is hard. Because you have to start your whole life over so you can get a job and provide for your family. This is what I think the mood of the article is about in the memoir.	2
12145	they'd sald what little furniture they'd possessed by then	1
12973	"I believe the was more of a ""thank you"" in the memoir and here a three reasons. I think Narciso Rodriguez is thanking his parents for making him have a good childhood. Like in the excerpt ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home. Another reason I think he's thanking his parents because he was praising them. In the excerpt ""I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" @CAPS1 Narciso is forever grateful to his parents. Like in the excerpt ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" These are the three ways the mood was more of a ""thank you"" kind of thing in the memoir."	3
13187	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" From Home: The Blueprints of our lives, the mood  conveyed to me were, happiness, gratfullness, and sadness. First the mood conveyed was a mood of happiness. The speaker is speaking about his community when he says ""All of these cultures come together in great solidarity and friendship""  (paragraph @NUM1). When it says ""came together"" this shows the happiness  the speaker must of fealt in the story. Secondly the mood was one of grate fullness. When the speaker was speaking about his parents he said ""I will always be grate ful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" (paragraph @NUM2) When it says ""grateful"" This shows that the speaker has alot of respect for his parents. lastly the mood conveyed to me was one of sadness. When the speaker is speaking about his parents he says ""What they did was much more courageous thing than I could have ever done"" (paragraph @NUM2). When he says ""have ever done"" he feels sad that he wont have the chance to repay them. Allinall the moods conveyed to me in the story were, happiness, gratefullness, and sadness."	4
13610	"The mood created by the memoir is greatfulness. I think this because this is one of the words he uses over and over again to show emphasis. Narciso says ""... And for which I am eternally grateful. (paragraph @NUM1). In paragraph @NUM2 he also says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Narciso's memoir states all the things he is grateful for this is why I believe greatfulness is the mood of this passage"	2
12569	"In the memoir, the mood created by the author is very understandable and true. Throughout the memoir the author says how grateful he is for his parents. In the memoir Narciso explains, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Narciso's parents had to go through a lot of hard things. They had to leave their country, their friends and family, and they had to pretty much start their lives over again. But his parents stood strong in those hard times. They cared and taught Narciso many important things. The mood the author sets is very loving. The author had very incredible parents that he is very grateful for."	2
13211	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a loving mood. In the memoir, the author talks a lot about family. And even though they weren't blood related, he considered many people his family. In the text it says ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all these cultures came together in great Solidarity and Friendship. It was a close-knit community...."" @CAPS1 example of the mood being loving is the author talks about his parents being selfless and leaving so much behind. And they did all that just to make sure he got a better life. In the memoir it says ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" Also, the mood is loving because the author talks about how grateful he is. He's grateful to how much his parents did so much for him and others. In the story it says ""I will never forget how my parents turned that simple house into a home."" @CAPS2 are ways that explain why this memoirs mood is a loving mood."	3

Throughout the excerpt, it shows his gratefulness towards his life living with his family, his life in his home, and his overall life living in @LOCATION1. Reading this makes me feel grateful to live in @LOCATION1. It even mentions in the passage that he's ""grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" It uses words such as ""warm"", which here means friendly, ""aroma"", ""rich"", and ""solidarity"". All these words, and many other words close in meaning, set this mood. In the @NUM1 paragraph it mentions all the sacrifice that his parents took to get their family to @LOCATION1. And then it talks about his gratefulness, to truly show the contrast between sacrifice and the state of being grateful. Those are the reasons that point to the mood of this excerpt being grateful, or gratefulness."	4

12231	"The author in the memoir from Home: The Blueprints of our lives creates the mood of gratitude and admiration towards his parents.One example of how the author shows gratitude is by mentioning how thankful he is toward his parents. Specific textual evidence that proves this is ""... unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" This quotation creates the mood of appreciation by simply stating ""eternally grateful"". Furthermore, another textual evidence which proves my thesis is ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1 the authors use and repititon of the word ""grateful"", or ""thankful"" creates a mood.Another example of how the author creates a mood is by showing admiration for his parents. According to the text he says ""I've often told my admiration for their strength and perseverance."" This quotation is important because it shows that he has told them he admires them. The author also creates the mood of admiration when he says ""... what they did was a much more courageous thing that I could have ever done."" @CAPS2 this quotation the author recognizes that his parents faced many hardships, and praises them by showing his admiration."	4

The parents turned a simple house into a home.	2
12865	In the memoir what was the mood created by the author.First, I feel that the mood created by the author is both happy and sad. I feel that they are sad because they moved from Cuba to @LOCATION1 where they left all of their friends and family and careers they loved behind. They also struggled both personaly and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships. Although they were sad I also felt that they were happy. I thought this because even though they moved from the place they loved they have one thing that made them feel at home. I think that it was there home and each other because they have there home Just as they like like, like when they were back home. I felt that the mood was both happy and sad in this memoir.	3
13517	In the @CAPS1 by Narciso Rodriguez, Narciso seems to get a certin mood, tward his parents, a mood of happyness and greatfullness.Thorought the hole @CAPS1 Narciso is constantly thanking his parents for everything they have done, and gave up just for him to have a better life. His parents gave up their Jobs, thier houses, they left ther family there, thier friends, and in return they go to @CAPS2 and give thier son a better life, witch he is constantly saying how greatfull, and how honored he is to have parents who will give up everything they had for him Over All thorought The @CAPS1 @PERSON1 sets a mood of happiness, and gratfull ness tward his loving parents.	3
11921	"The mood created in this memoir was very greatful. Narciso was very very greatful for the ""house that his parents turned into a home."" And he was very greatful to his overall parents, for giving up there own life, to try to give their son a better one, with many more oppertunities than they had. He is also greatful to his parents, not only for giving him things they never had, but things they did have, too. Things like teaching them how to cook, how to treat others, and the real meaning of family. They also showed him the value of being selfless for someone you love."	3
11878	"The mood created by the author is a happy mood. I think that it is a happy mood because Narciso is describing his life, and at the end he says he has a happy life. ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). I think that this is a happy statement because he is saying that his parents cared so much for him, and they turned what could have been a bad house, into a home. I think that it is a happy mood because of the way he talks about his neighbors. ""It was a close  knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need"" (@CAPS1 @NUM2). I think that since he talks about his friends and neighbors so well that it is a happy neighborhood. A @NUM3 and final reason I think it is a happy mood is because of the way he speaks of his family. ""They came selflessly to give their children a better life I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice"" (@CAPS3 @NUM4 and @NUM5). I think that he loves his family, and love is definitely a happy word."	3

13267	"The mood created in this memoir is friendship. One reason is because his parents let the door open for the peope they considered family. A quote that shows this is ""My parents always kept their arms and their doors to the many people we consider family. This shows that the mood is friendship because his parents are great friends to their family.        A second reason is the importance of friend ship. A quote that shows this is ""the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" This show that the mood is friendship because his parents taught him friendship his whole life."	3
12642	The mood created by the auther was happy, thoughtful, and very polite. Narciso talked about his family and his life! He also was talking about how he loved his family and what he does best like cooking and playing his Cuban music.	1
12515	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from @CAPS1: The Blueprints of Our Lives The mood created by the author in the memoir is very cultural and family.

13313	"The mood created in Narciso Rodriguez's  passage is loving and grateful. Narciso creates the image of a very happy childhood, while comparing her happiness to the hard work her parents toiled through and all the things they sacrificed for her. @CAPS1 often describes the feeling of closeness between her neighborhood and her family. 'In our neighborhood... all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close-knit community of honest, hard-working immigrants..' Their family consisted of a variety of people, not necessarily related, but there was always a helping hand for each other in the community in times of trouble. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family."" The warmth of her childhood life is expressed in the line, 'Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home.' Narciso gives many examples of her happiness, but @CAPS1 always refers back to the hard work of her parents. @CAPS1 thanks her parents for giving her the opportunity to experience a better life. 'I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice...' I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love.' @CAPS1 feels very grateful for her parent's strife to help her and for such an accepting neighborhood. The mood of the passage is loving and grateful."	4
13606	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, Narciso mood in the memoir seemed happy and grate. Narciso's mood sound happy because when he was telling us (readers) about his life growing up in Newark, New Jersey and explaining how his house was he was saying how his landlord and daughter nice and how the landlord's daughter was his first friend, and he was also saying how his family and friends were very close. In the neighborhood it was despite customs elsewhere, all of the cultures came together in great solidarity (happiness) and friendship. His mother and father made the house cozy and at the end of the memoir the author said ""I will never forget how his parents turned their simple house into a home meaning that he never had a home like the one he lived in now."	3
11941	"The mood created by the author is warmth. First off, in paragraph two, it says how his family would always cook food and turn on the cuban music. It also says how the smell of the food would fill the house. In paragraph four, it says how they would always have family members over for dinner. Some of the family members they would have were Grandparents, Aunts, @CAPS1, and cousins. The last reason the mood is warmth is because he said in paragraph seven, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" That means that before they lived there, it was just three rooms; however, once they moved in, they turned it into a place where friends and family could gather and have fun."	3
11997	"In the memoir, Home: Blueprints of our Lives, by Narciso Rodriguez, @CAPS3 sets a mood of warm, loving, and fun. @CAPS2-out of the whole memoir, Narciso talks about how his family moved into a home in Newark, New Jersey, and... ""within it's walls, my young parents created our traditional cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen,"" @CAPS1 you picture that in your mind you create a very warm, tasty, good-smelling room, which helps create a mood for the whole memoir. Another way Narciso creates mood is when @CAPS3 talks about the cuban music flowing @CAPS2 the house, ""Passionate Cuban music...filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" With this @CAPS3 shows that it was fun, warm, inviting, and exciting. @CAPS3 says, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family, and friends, and endless celebrations that encommpassed, both, formed a backdrop, to life in our warm home."" @CAPS3 also creates a mood of fun, warm, entertaining, and loving feeling, by describing parties, celebrations, with friends and family, In This memoir, the author sets a mood of warm, loving, fun, and entertaining."	4
13522	The mood Narciso Rodriguez creates is gratefullness. When I read this, I feel thankful like the author. Although his family had a good life in Cuba, they left to give their kids a better life. @CAPS1 the author's family hadn't left Cuba, I think the mood would be different. Then the author wouldn't think his parents were selfless (for that reason, anyway) @CAPS1 my parents did that for my siblings and me, I would want people to feel grateful as well. @PERSON1 understands how hard it was for his parents. Another mood could be guilt. I feel guilty when I read this because I don't always thank my parents or apreciate them. Narciso Rodriguez created a lot of moods in the memoir.	2
13518	"The mood in the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives is happy and sympathetic. One reason is they never gave up no matter how hard it was.

The author wrote, ""all lived nearby and regularly joined us at our table, ""this shows that their whole family was very close to each other. My final reason is that the Rodriguez's always wanted to help. Narciso said, ""My parents always kept their arms and their doors open,"" which shows that they always wanted to help people in need. The mood in the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives is happy and sympathetic."	3
13385	"In the memoir, the mood seems to be happy, and grateful. To me it seems as if the author is trying to show his great love and respect for his parents and how they have taught him everything he knows and without them he would be nowhere.     ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice I've often told them that what they did was a much more courages thing thing than I could have ever done."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1)       This shows me that the author's mood is set to be happy and about love and how he is extremley grateful to have them in his life Also it shows his love for what his parents have taught him.     ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed onto me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful.)

"" @CAPS1 explains how it there were people of no relation who were considered family. His parents would keep ""their arms and the door open to the people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us.""

13208	"The moods created by the author in the memoir are loving, care, family, sacrafice, and warmth. All of these moods are demonstrated when the author describes all of what her interpretation of family is, and when she described everything her parents have done for her. The passage that states: ""they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."", @CAPS1 that the parents sacrificed so much, and cared and loved their children so much that they were willing to give up their lives in their country and leave behind everything in order to make Narciso's life better. Their family provided warmth and care for everyone who needed it. They truly learned the real meaning of family. The author created a very loving mood in this memoir."	3
13466	The mood created by the author in this memoir is comforting. His memoir shows his past life and how he felt about it.

He's also showing his appreciation for his parent for making sacrafices for him so he could have more opportunities and education. He's also being very descriptive about his childhood and showing the type of life he had and what he and his parents had to go through when they came to @LOCATION1 and how they don't want people going through the same thing as them so they helped Immigrants who needed support.	2
11827	In this memoir of Narciso Rodriguez, @PERSON3's life, the mood containing it all, was greatful, and showed how his parents gave him love through his whole life. Both his parents were born and raised in Cuba, and in 1956, they both moved to the United States. Starting their lives over again, and taking any job they could find. Then in 1961, @PERSON2, @CAPS1. was born. Both Parents raised him with love, and care, and introducing his Cuban background into his life.        As @PERSON2, was telling his story, all readers could tell how greatful he was to have a family like he did. Also, as he shared his non- blood related family, and the remembrence on how his parents' life changed by moving to @LOCATION2, he showed the respect he had towards them.	2
13284	In this passage the mood to me is like relaxing and a soothing gratefulness towards his parents. The tone of his voice is not angry, not happy happy but soothing. Obviously Narciso loves his family and loves @LOCATION1. By the tone of the narrators voice shows that. Coming to @CAPS1 was a great change as he said because you leave behind so many friends, family and the presence of the culture. Family to Narciso is his relatives but culture as well. As you can see the tone of the narrators voice really makes the story interesting.	2
13408	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" Narciso tells all about his parents and how greatful he is. Narciso created a mood during this memoir, he talked about his mom and dad and how they created his house into a home. Narciso's parents sacrificed a lot to move to @LOCATION1 and give their children a good life, even if it meant them having to leave behind family, friends and careers. The mood created overall was that I felt thankful for my home and family here in @LOCATION1. Then I also felt sympathy for Narciso's parents for leaving everything behind for their children. they also had to leave behind family, which is very hard to do. Narciso's parents made a very tough but wise deisicon but in the end it was worth it."	3
